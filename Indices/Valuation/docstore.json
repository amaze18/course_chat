We believe that the book has succeeded because it is grounded in universal economic \nprinciples. While we continue to improve and update the text as our experience grows, the fundamental \nprinciples do not chan ge. The y are valid across time and geography.\nOur message is simple: Companies thrive when they create real economic value for their \nshareholders. Companies create value by investing capital at rates of return that exceed their cost of capital. This applies equally to U.S., European, and Asian companies. It applies equally to mature manufacturing companies and high-growth Internet companies. Only the implementation details are different.\nWhen companies forget these simple truths, consequences are evident: hostile takeovers in the \nUnited States in the 1980s, the collapse of the bubble economy in Japan in the 1990s, the broad Southeast Asian crisis in 1998, and the persistent slow growth and high unemployment in Europe. While the underlying drivers of these events can be traced to a number of factors\u2014most often \ninappropriate government policies or structural deficiencies\u2014the lack of focus on value creation by \nmana\ngers is a ke y link in the chain leadin g to economic malaise or crisis.\nWe wrote this book for managers (and future managers) who want their companies to create value. \nIt is a how-to book. We hope that it is a book that you will use again and again. If we have done our \njob well, it will soon be transformed with underlining, margin notations, and highlighting. This is no \ncoffee-table book.\nThe Need to Mana ge Value\nIn the last two decades, two kinds of thinking and activity\u2014corporate finance and corporate \nstrate gy\u2014have come to gether with a resoundin g crash.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 1841, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "138d5134-70a3-4564-a227-ad0774b48c16": {"__data__": {"id_": "138d5134-70a3-4564-a227-ad0774b48c16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8b75c9c-2170-429e-998f-bd62aa163dbd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "07dc6168315e347adc4f76e33f3d1d41199b74a795101da37a550e4969073711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "065f49e2-565c-4a7d-9ec3-1b792e7f91c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "32737367a4933ad307572e4277689fea6906ca755f24d247585522ad4d571dc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "07232709-bfe6-40cd-ae9a-59e181538b15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4225c7d9402adcd3aab8aeaf6dc0093a18239a55b77c6afa8807d5da9fee4660", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page viii\nCorporate finance is no longer the exclusive preserve of financiers. Corporate strategy is no longer a \nseparate realm ruled by CEOs. Participants in the financial markets are increasingly involved in \nbusiness operations through leveraged buyouts, hostile takeovers, and proxy contests. At the same \ntime, chief executives have led their companies to become increasingly active players in the financial markets through mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, leveraged buyouts, share repurchases, and the like. Financing and investment are now inextricably connected. In the Internet \nworld, for example, having a high share value is essential for making acquisitions and attracting \ntalent.\nThis new reality presents a challenge to business managers: the need to manage value  and to focus \nas never before on the value their corporate and business-level strategies are creating. In the quest \nfor value, they find that they must consider such radical alternatives as selling the ''crown jewels\" or \ncompletely restructuring operations. And they need more systematic and reliable ways to look for opportunities in the turbulence resulting from the confluence of strategy and finance. As a result of restructuring, for instance, companies create new opportunities to acquire assets and businesses that \nma\ny be worth more to them than to their ori ginal owners.\nWhy This Boo k\nThis book began life as a handbook for McKinsey consultants. This beginning is reflected in the \nnature of the book. While the book draws on leading edge academic thinking, its purpose is practical \napplication. It aims to demystify the field of valuation and to clarify the linkages between strategy \nand finance.\nWe believe that clear thinking about valuation and skill in using valuation to guide business \ndecisions are prerequisites for success in today's competitive environment. Value needs to be \nunderstood clearly by CEOs, business managers, and financial managers alike. Too often, valuation \nhas been left to experts. It has been viewed as a specialized discipline, rather than as an important tool for runnin\ng the business better.\nIn this book, we hope to lift the veil on valuation by explaining, step-by-step, how to do it well. We \nspell out valuation frameworks that we use in our consulting work, and we bring these frameworks to life with detailed case studies that highlight the practical judgments involved in developing and using valuations. Most significantly, we discuss how to use valuation to make decisions about courses of action for a com\npany.\nThis book can be used b y a wide audience, includin g:\n\u2022 Business managers .

Valuation is an age-old \nmethodology in finance with its intellectual origins in the present value method of capital budgeting and in the valuation approach developed by Professors Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani, both \nNobel laureates, in their 1961 Journal of Business  article entitled \"Dividend Policy, Growth and the \nValuation of Shares.\" Our intellectual debt is primarily to them, but others have gone far to \npopularize their approach. In particular, Professor Alfred Rappaport of Northwestern University (co-founder of ALCAR) and Joel Stern (of Stern Stewart & Co.) were among the first to extend the Miller-Modigliani entity valuation formula to real-world applications and to develop and market com\nputer tools for makin g this an eas y task for com panies.\nStructure of the Boo k\nThe book is organized into three parts. Part One provides a managerial perspective on valuation and \nmanaging shareholder value. Part Two is a step-by-step approach to valuing a company. Part Three deals with more com\nplex valuation issues and s pecial cases.\nIn Part One, we discuss the link between business strategies and value. In Chapter 1, we make the \ncase that managing shareholder value is a central role and challenge for senior managers. In Chapter 2, we develop a picture of what it means to be a value manager. We do this through a detailed case \nstudy based on the actual experiences of a CEO who needed to restructure his company and build a \nnew managing-value philosophy throughout it. Chapter 3 summarizes the basic principles of value creation through a simple case example, focusing on the intuition behind the approach, not the mathematics. Chapter 4 attempts to sort through the confusing jargon about various metrics that you will come across by providing a simple, yet comprehensive framework. Chapter 5 provides the \nempirical evidence supporting our discounted cash flow view of valuation. Chapter 6 describes the \nsofter aspects of implementing value management. Finally, Chapter 7 provides an overview of value creation in the context of mer\ngers, ac quisitions, and alliances.\nPart Two\u2014Chapters 8 through 13\u2014is a self-contained handbook for doing valuations of single-\nbusiness companies. In it we describe a general approach to discounted cash flow valuations and how to implement it. This includes how to analyze historical performance, forecast free cash flows, estimate the appropriate opportunity cost of capital, identify sources of value, and interpret results.

Building on these \nexperiences, we have extensively rewritten and updated core chapters, adding more detail on practical issues that managers and analysts face. We have updated most of the examples and empirical analysis. We have also added six new chapters. Entirely new chapters have been added on valuing Internet companies, valuing cyclical companies, and valuing insurance companies. Valuing \ncompanies in emerging markets now warrants its own chapter. Finally, we have created two \nchapters early in the book, one that provides a nonmathematical, intuitive overview of the principles of value creation, and one that provides an overarching framework for cutting through the confusion of mana\ngement performance metrics.\nValuation Spreadsheet\nAn Excel spreadsheet valuation model is available on CD-ROM. This valuation model is similar to \nthe model we use in practice.

We have \nincluded chapters on valuing high growth Internet companies, multibusiness companies, cyclical companies, banks, and insurance companies. Three chapters deal with issues related to valuation outside the United States: valuing foreign subsidiaries, valuing companies outside the United States, \nand valuing companies in emerging markets. Finally, we explore the application of option pricing \ntheor\ny to assets, liabilities, and investment decisions.\nWhat's New about the Third Edition\nIn the 10 years between the first and third editions, we have gained experience applying valuation in \nour consulting work and have received considerable feedback from readers. Building on these \nexperiences, we have extensively rewritten and updated core chapters, adding more detail on practical issues that managers and analysts face. We have updated most of the examples and empirical analysis. We have also added six new chapters. Entirely new chapters have been added on valuing Internet companies, valuing cyclical companies, and valuing insurance companies. Valuing \ncompanies in emerging markets now warrants its own chapter. Finally, we have created two \nchapters early in the book, one that provides a nonmathematical, intuitive overview of the principles of value creation, and one that provides an overarching framework for cutting through the confusion of mana\ngement performance metrics.\nValuation Spreadsheet\nAn Excel spreadsheet valuation model is available on CD-ROM. This valuation model is similar to \nthe model we use in practice.

This book is certainly no exception, especially since it \ngrew out of the collective work of McKinsey's corporate finance practice and the experiences of \nconsultants throu ghout the world.\nFirst, we would like to thank Ennius Bergsma. Ennius initiated the development of McKinsey's \ncorporate finance practice in the mid-1980s and was instrumental in bringing the three authors \ntogether. He encouraged us to turn our original internal McKinsey valuation handbook into a real book for an external audience. He mustered the internal support and sponsorship that we needed to make this happen. Ennius has always been a key discussion partner for us. He also co-wrote Chapter 1, Wh\ny Value Value?\nFred Gluck deserves our special thanks. Fred played a vital role in creating a knowledge building \nculture within McKinsey. As the firm's Managing Director, he was like a godfather to many of us and our colleagues. Fred was a vocal supporter of creating a strong corporate financial advisory \npractice at McKinse y.\nFor the third edition, we would like to thank several people who worked closely with us on key \nchapters. David Krieger prepared the analysis and valuation of Heineken that appears throughout the book. Susan Nolen contributed to Chapter 6, Making Value Happen,  drawing from an internal \nproject she was leading. Mimi James guided us through the complexities of valuing companies in \nemerging market countries in Chapter 19. Alice Hu brought us into the Internet world, helping us write Chapter 15, Valuing Dot.coms . Marco de Heer's thesis on valuing cyclical companies formed \nthe basis for Chapter 16. Vladimir Antikarov and Phil Keenan were steadfast thought partners for the option pricing work in Chapter 20. Gabriel Garcia and Mimi James were instrumental in \ndeveloping Chapter 22 on valuing insurance companies.

Additionally, a professional workbook accompanies this book. \nWe would like to thank Bill Foote for preparing the pedagogy for the University edition and for creating the Valuation Workbook . This workbook is an important complement to the text for \npractitioners and students alike.\nWe couldn't have devoted the time and energy to this book without the support and encouragement \nof McKinsey's corporate finance and strategy practice leadership, in particular Christian Caspar and Ron Hulme. We also thank Alan Kantrow for his sa\nge counsel.\nThank you as well to our editors at Wiley, Pamela van Giessen and Claudio Campuzano, and to \nNancy Marcus Land and her staff at Publications Development Company for copyediting and \nproduction.\nFinally, thank you to Maggie Copeland, Melissa Koller, and Wendy Murdock, our most important \nsupporters.

information about valuation to make wiser \nbusiness decisions. Underlying it is our basic belief that managers who focus on building \nshareholder value will create healthier companies than those who do not. We also think that healthier companies will, in turn, lead to stronger economies, higher living standards, and more career and business o\npportunities for individuals.\nThere has always been, and continues to be, vigorous debate on the importance of shareholder value \nrelative to other measures such as employment, social responsibility, and the environment. The debate is often cast in terms of shareholder versus stakeholder. At least in ideology and legal frameworks, the United States and the United Kingdom have given the most weight to the idea that \nshareholders are the owners of the corporation, the board of directors is their representative and \nelected b\ny them, and the ob jective function of the cor poration is to maximize shareholder value.\nIn continental Europe, an explicitly broader view of the objectives of business organizations has \nlong been more influential. In many cases, it has been incorporated into the governance structures of \nthe corporation form of organization. Under Dutch law, for example, the board of a Structural \nN.V.\u2014effectively a large corporation\u2014is mandated to ensure the continuity of the business, not to \nrepresent shareholders in the pursuit of value maximization. Similar philosophies lay at the foundation of cor\nporate governance in German y and Scandinavia.\nOur principal aim in this book is not to analyze, resolve, or even stoke the debate between \nshareholder and stakeholder models. However, we believe managers should focus on value creation for two reasons.

Second, shareholder-oriented economies appear to perform better than other \neconomic s ystems and other stakeholders do not suffer at the hands of shareholders.\nAscendancy of Shareholder Value\nEarly in 2000, Vodafone AirTouch acquired the German conglomerate Mannesmann, the first major \nhostile takeover of a German company by a non-German company.1 This event signaled the \nbroadening acceptance of the shareholder value model in Europe. It might now be argued that \nmanagers in most of the developed world must focus on building shareholder value. Four major factors have \nplayed a role in the ascendanc y of shareholder value:\n1. The emergence of an active market for corporate control in the 1980s, following the apparent \ninabilit y of man y mana gement teams to res pond effectivel y to ma jor chan ges in their industries.\n2. The growing importance of equity-based features in the pay packages of most senior executives \nin the United States and man y in Euro pe as well.\n3. The increased penetration of equity holdings as a percentage of household assets, following the \nstron g performance of the U.S. and Euro pean e quity markets since 1982.\n4. The growing recognition that many social security systems, especially in continental Europe and \nJapan, are headin g for insolvenc y.\nThe Market for Corporate Control\nIn 1982, the U.S. economy started to recover from a prolonged period of high inflation and low \neconomic growth. Many industrial sectors required major restructuring. For example, the invention \nof the radial tire had more than doubled the effective life of tires, leading to huge overcapacity. Rather than eliminating excess capacity and taking cash out of the business, most major tire manufacturers continued investing heavily, setting themselves up for a rude awakening later in the \ndecade.\nAt the same time, pension funds and insurance companies began to provide increasingly large pools \nof funds to new kinds of investors, principally leveraged buyout (LBO) groups such as Kohlberg, Kravis, and Roberts (KKR) and Clayton, Dubilier, and Rice.

Probably more important than the hard numbers was the perception of what \nwas happening in the marketplace. The size of the leveraged buyouts had become huge, with the \nRJR-Nabisco transaction topping the charts at $31.4 billion. This was only four years after the first leveraged buyout exceeding $1 billion, KKR's purchase of the conglomerate Wometco in 1984. While many leveraged buyouts were friendly, the vehicle lent itself to hostile acquisitions as well. \nIndeed, the most visible hostile transactions in the late 1980s were LBOs, of which RJR-Nabisco \nwas a leadin\ng exam ple.\nThe structure of a leveraged buyout, combined with the emergence of high-yield bonds as a major \nfunding instrument, put much of corporate America within range of hostile takeovers. Not \nsurprisingly, companies that were not dealing effectively with major changes in their industry \nbecame targets. In the tire industry, BF Goodrich and UniRoyal were restructured on a friendly \nbasis, but Good year and GenCor p (the owners of General Tire ) came under attack.\nThis emergence of the market for corporate control provoked a backlash from established \nenterprises and their executives. By 1984, the Business Roundtable, an organization that represents the largest corporations in the United States, had already issued a working paper that supported the stakeholder view of corporate governance, largely echoing the prevalent point of view in Europe. By the end of the decade, an increasingly large and vocal opposition to the market for corporate \ncontrol\u2014as embodied by highly leveraged and hostile transactions\u2014led to its curtailment, but only \ntem\nporaril y.\nBy the end of the 1990s, the buyout market was again hot, except this time most of the deals were \nfriendly. Managers had learned the lessons of shareholder value and weren't waiting for hostile \nbidders. At the same time, the LBO had moved to Europe. Many European buyout groups were \nformed and American firms be gan to look for deals in Euro pe as well.\nHow do LBOs create value? The argument runs along these lines: Many mature, established \nindustries that have been subject to hostile takeovers generate high levels of free cash flow. Some \ncompanies in this situation, such as those in the tire, oil and gas, and consumer packaged goods industries, often do not have sufficient attractive investment opportunities. Nevertheless, the natural inclination of an enterprise is to reinvest its cash, rather than give it back to shareholders. Such an approach can result in bad investments that reduce shareholder value. The poor investments take \nthese forms: Money is invested in businesses that the company knows, but are not attractive, or in \nbusinesses it does not know and is unlikel y to succeed in.\n2 G.

In the case of an LBO, this occurs through substituting equity with debt, \nforcing much of the free cash flow out of the enterprise and back into the capital markets in the form \nof interest and principal payments. This need not be done through outside intervention; it can also be accomplished voluntarily through a leveraged recapitalization, where a company takes on debt and uses the \nproceeds to re purchase a lar ge proportion of its own e quity.\nWhat both situations have in common, though, is that they usually lead to significant increases in \nvalue accruing to existing shareholders. Indeed, if the corporate objective is shareholder value maximization, spending on unattractive investments is much more likely to be curtailed than if mana\ngers are followin g some other ob jective, such as em ployment preservation.\nTo summarize, the restructuring movement of the 1980s was a reaction to the inability of many \ncorporations to adjust and change direction as their traditional product and market opportunities matured or became otherwise unattractive. The instrument through which much of this restructuring \ntook place was the market for corporate control. The basic premise of the market for corporate \ncontrol is that managers have the right to manage the corporation as long as its market value cannot \nbe significantly enhanced by an alternate group of managers with an alternate strategy. Accordingly, \nthe ke y driver for chan ge was the poor performance of a com pany in terms of shareholder value.\nThe Increased Role o f Stock Options\nIn the mid-1970s in the United States, there was growing concern about the perceived divergence \nbetween managers' and shareholders' interest. In part, this feeling reflected anxiousness over 10 years of falling corporate profitability and stagnant share prices. The concern was also fueled by the \nincreasing attention paid to stakeholder model arguments, which, in the eyes of shareholder value \nproponents, had become an excuse for inadequate performance. Meanwhile, a number of academics became interested in management's motivation in decisions relating to the allocation of resources, a branch of research known as agency theory.

The emergence of the LBO, and especially the management buyout, created instances whe re both the \nperformance of the company in shareholder value terms and the pay packages accruing to executives as a result of their equity h oldings became very \nlarge and noted by the public. At about the same time, in 1982, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board embarked on a program that drast ically reduced \ninflation, which in turn prompted a sustained rise in equity values. As a result of this confluence of factors, the role of sto ck options in executive pay \nsoared. As illustrated in Exhibit 1.1, by 1998, the estimated present value of stock options represented 45 percent of the medi an pay package for chief \nexecutive officers of public cor porations.\nOver the same period, boards of directors had come under increased criticism for perceived negligence in representing sharehold er interests (which, at \nleast under the legal requirements in the United States, they were supposed to do).

This system worked fine as long as there were relatively few \nretirees in relation to contributin g workers. This is chan ging.\nIn 1990, for example, there were almost two workers in Germany to support one retiree. By 2035, \nthis number will drop to one retiree per worker. As a consequence, the average contribution rate for a German worker to the mandatory public pension system will rise to 34.1 percent of gross wages in \n2035 if no actions are taken, compared with 19.7 percent in 1996. This is the stuff of which \nrevolutions are made.\nAlthough avoiding a pension crisis is possible, there are no easy fixes. Most analysts agree that \nthese countries have no choice but to move to some form of funded pension system, where at least a \npart of the premiums that workers pay are actually set aside for their retirement. The challenge is \nhow to make it through the transition from pure pay-as-you-go to partially or wholly funded. While there are several variations of funded pensions systems, they all lead to the same conclusion\u2014there is no solution unless the savin\ngs in the funded part o f the s ystem generate attractive returns .\nWith this in mind, one solution would be to increase premiums by a sufficient amount to build a \nsurplus that can be reinvested, with the combination of premiums and investment returns covering the future shortfall. Here is a simplified example of how this might work in Germany. If the additional premiums were invested in German government bonds, which historically have yielded \nreal returns of about 4 percent, the necessary incremental premium would amount to 3,103 marks, a \n13 percent reduction in disposable income. If, on the other hand, these savings were invested in Germany's private sector, where real long-term returns between 1974 and 1993 have averaged 7.4 \npercent, these premiums would drop to 2,068 marks. If the German private sector were as successful \nas its U.S. equivalent, which generated real long-term returns in the same period of 9.1 percent, the \nannual premiums would dro p to 1,706 marks, a reduction in dis posable income of just 7 percent.\nThus, in combination with measures such as gradually increasing the retirement age, the burden can \nbe reduced to a level where political consensus becomes feasible, if the investment funds generate \ngood returns. Defusing the pension fund bomb dictates that the private sector be held to a standard \nwhere generating high returns on invested capital and creating opportunities to invest additional capital at high returns is of paramount importance. It is not coincidental that California's public employee retirement fund is one of the most vocal advocates of creating shareholder value in the United States, and has made it clear that it expects shareholder value to be a priority in other \nmarkets.\nIf the funded plans are to work and intergenerational competition is to be avoided\u2014whether in \nGermany or other developed nations\u2014then there must be steady pressure on companies to generate \nshareholder value.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 3074, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "784eea95-9738-439d-ac0d-3ca5f3e3fb76": {"__data__": {"id_": "784eea95-9738-439d-ac0d-3ca5f3e3fb76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["United States", "U.S."]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "04f98ed5-85c3-4e2d-ab1b-362288b851ab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "6b5674dface82689408491489bb647052157fed194466b19d777e2546dfab74a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d4d085f-5465-4125-9da7-51e8ca1ba174", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "626faa5d98ed428d1c4e4501f5ed4cbf2ecc0357996a5052d8865aca81176c2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f97192f-355d-4769-b75c-d9aa62c8569d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7429b4ea4a55b64e04615ad0ff4d3a6fc265fef3ee92932dc6946bcf5c002127", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 11\nShareholder-Oriented Economies Perform Better\nWe doubt that the strong economic performance of the United States since the mid-1980s would have taken place without the disci pline of shareholder \ncapitalism and an increasin gly shar p eye by man y partici pants in its econom y on creatin g shareholder value.\nThe U.S. corporate focus on shareholder value tends to limit investment in outdated strategies\u2014even encourage divestment\u2014well b efore any \ncompeting governance model would.

Consequently, the need for major restructuring that goes with large performance gaps will be less likely to arise. Those who manage value well can guide their companies in a series of smaller steps to the higher levels of performance that even the most comprehensive of restructurings cannot match.\nIn the balance of this chapter, we illustrate the integrated application of value management \nprinciples by presenting a case example distilled from the real-world experiences of client executives with whom we have worked.

For the previous 10 \nyears, Ralph had been president of Consumerco, EG Corporation's largest division. Consumerco had been the original business of EG before it entered other lines through acquisition. Major institutional shareholders had \nrecently become dissatisfied with EG's performance.\nThe EG Business\nEG Corporation had sales of just over $3.5 billion in 1998. The company was in three main lines of business\u2014consumer products, food service, and furniture\u2014with its Consumerco, Foodco, and Woodco divisions.\nConsumerco manufactured consumer products and sold them through a direct salesforce to grocery and \ndrugstores throughout the United States. It had a dominant market share (more than 40 percent) in the majority of its product lines, all of which had a strong branded consumer franchise.\nWoodco was a mid-sized competitor in the highly fragmented furniture business.

As of early 1999, the companies were still operated as \nautonomous units, but EG had begun to combine the companies into one unit, consolidating separate administration, sales, and production functions to the extent feasible. EG also planned to establish an umbrella \nbrand to tie together the wide range of Woodco product offerings and establish a base for adding new lines.\nThus far, the Woodco businesses had turned in uneven financial results. Management capability in the eight \nbusinesses varied widely. Moreover, Woodco's business performance was to differing degrees dependent on keeping up with the latest in furniture styling and fashion. Some of the companies were skilled in this area, but \nthe disastrous consequences of missing the trends had been brought home over the years by their uneven \nperformance. Despite this, Woodco's management was convinced that EG could build a large and successful business. The managers believed consolidation would reduce Woodco's operating costs significantly and strengthen the company's management control over the businesses. They thought the new common sales and \nmarketing thrust would lead to increased volumes and higher margins. The Woodco management's convictions \nwere lent some credence by the existence of several other players in the industry that earned consistently high returns, achieved in part by rationalizing less-efficient companies that they had acquired.\nFoodco, EG's third main division, was in the food service business. Foodco operated a small chain of fast-food \nrestaurants, as well as providing food service under contract to major corporations and other institutions around \nthe country. It had been essentially built up from internal growth plus a few small acquisitions over the last five years. The former CEO had viewed Foodco as a major growth vehicle for EG and had backed aggressive expansion plans and the associated capital spending. As of early 1999, EG's Foodco unit was earning a profit \nbut was still in the early stages of its development plan. It was a small player in the restaurant business and had \nonly a few institutional food service accounts. In both businesses, it faced formidable competition, but management believed that its operating approach and EG Corporation's Consumerco name recognition, which \nwas being used as the branding proposition for Foodco, would establish Foodco as a major factor in the \nindustry.\nBeyond Consumerco, Foodco, and Woodco, EG Corporation owned a few other smaller businesses: a property \ndevelopment company (Propco), a small consumer finance company (Finco), and several small newspapers \n(Newsco). No one currently employed by EG could recall why EG had acquired these businesses. They had \nbeen added to the portfolio in the 1970s. All were earning a profit, though they were small by comparison with EG's three main divisions. (See Exhibit 2.1.)\nEG's Financial Performance\nOverall, EG Corporation's financial performance had been mediocre for the last five years. Earnings growth had not kept pace with inflation, and return on equity had been hovering around 10 percent. Part of the problem was that EG had been hit with unfavorable ''extraordinary items\" that had depressed bottom line results. \nBeyond this, though, the company had failed to deliver on overall commitments for growth and operating \nearnings in its businesses for the last few years.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 3452, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c7040a7-bbd8-476b-8efb-d3bd7be00b1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c7040a7-bbd8-476b-8efb-d3bd7be00b1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["Ralph Demsky", "EG Corporation"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a04e8a4f-e550-4e3a-b356-97387ce6f6a0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "b53a9f01e3c891013323777cacf81d434edffb6a0d57438c40909992e88711c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a1397a77-b162-4b50-bfc1-a570dd45c928", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "19abcbe9554c210aaf7bcdda26cd27f76bae1ed1bcc31c17f633f7e66c36014a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3be1c55c-9a63-43e6-8288-d1af3c28fadf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3da7c1dc7e0c5109d4083494e46c5f408fa6ae160d63ffdec5cd8007a5812c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 20\nExhibit 2.1 EG Corporation\u2014Businesses\nFrom an investor's standpoint, the company's stock price had lagged the market for the last several years.

Ralph expected the project to provide actionable recommendations within six to eight weeks.\nRalph had thought long and hard about doing the review with a smaller team, perhaps consisting of him, the chief financial offi cer, and several financial analysts, to maintain \nsecrecy and speed up the process. However, he had rejected this alternative for several reasons. First, he wanted to draw on th e best judgment of his senior managers about \nthe prospects for their businesses. Second, he wanted to involve them from the outset because they would play a key role in car rying out the business improvements that \nwere sure to be identified. Finally, he wanted them to learn the process by doing it, since he planned to undertake a similar t horough review annually.\nAs an analytical framework, Ralph envisioned investigating the value of EG's existing businesses along six dimensions, which he  thought of as forming a restructuring \nhexagon (see Exhibit 2.2). The hexagon analysis would start with a thorough understanding of EG's current market value. Then th e team would assess the ''as is\" and \npotential value of EG's businesses with internal improvements, the external sale value of the businesses, growth opportunities,  and the opportunities to increase value \nthrough financial engineering. All these values would be tied back to EG's value in the stock market to estimate the potential gain to EG's shareholders from a thorough \nrestructuring. The comparison would also help to identify gaps in perceptions between investors and EG management about prospec ts for the businesses.

He already knew that EG had n ot performed particularly well for its \nshareholders in recent times and that operating returns had not been as good as everyone had hoped. But Ralph wanted to be more  systematic in his review of the market's \nperspective. His team set about examining EG's performance in the stock market, its underlying financial performance, how it ha d been generating and investing cash flow, \nand the market's implicit assumptions about its future performance.\nWhat Ralph found was disturbing\u2014and revealing. EG's return to investors had indeed been below the market overall and below the returns for a roughly assembled set of \n''comparable\" companies (see Exhibit 2.3). When he looked at the current valuation of EG relative to peers, he was disappointed , but not surprised, that his company was \nalso valued lower relative to the book value of invested capital (Exhibit 2.4).\nWhat also stood out from the analysis were a couple of events that had knocked down the value of EG relative to the market. In the period 1992 to 1997, EG had made \nseveral acquisitions to establish and build the Woodco furniture businesses. Ralph noticed a decline in EG's share price relati ve to comparable companies and the market \naround the date of each acquisition. In fact, when the team calculated the impact of these declines on the total value of EG, t hey realized that the decline in EG's total value \nwas about equal to the dollar amount of the premiums over market price EG had paid to acquire the companies.

Since EG had not in fact done anything to these companies since they were purchased, there was no reason for them to be worth any \nmore than their pre-acquisition value. It didn't seem to matter that the deals had been carefully structured and financed in pa rt with debt to avoid diluting EG's earnings per \nshare. The market had seen through those gimmicks.\nLooking next at the financial results of each of EG's businesses, the team noted that Consumerco had generated high, stable ret urns on invested capital (35+ percent) for the \nlast five years. However, the businesses' earnings were only growing at the pace of inflation. EG's Woodco business had suffere d steadily declining returns. The earnings of \nthe Foodco business, on the other hand, were growing, but returns on investment were low because of high capital investment req uirements in the restaurants. All of these \nfactors had conspired to depress overall EG returns on capital and hamper growth in profits.\nOne investment analysis Ralph found especially intriguing was a cash flow map of EG based on information for the last five year s (see Exhibit 2.5). What it showed was that \nEG had been generating substantial discretionary or free cash flow in the Consumerco business, a large portion of which had bee n sunk into Woodco and Foodco. Relatively \nlittle had been re-invested in Consumerco. Moreover, little of the cash had found its way back to EG's shareholders. In fact, o n a five-year basis, EG had in effect been \nborrowing to pay dividends to shareholders. Since Ralph believed that shareholder value derived from the cash flow returns EG c ould generate, he became increasingly \nsuspicious that EG had taken the cash Consumerco had generated and re-invested it in businesses that might not generate an adeq uate return for shareholders.\nTo round out his perspective on EG's valuation by the stock market, Ralph spent a day reading all the reports securities analys ts had written recently about the company.

In contrast, the  Woodco consolidation looked set to \nimprove the value of the furniture businesses dramatically, while the newspaper, finance, and property businesses would improve  somewhat, too.\nAt this stage, Ralph drew some conclusions. Consumerco would have to do even better, given its large impact on the company. Foo dco would need to revamp its strategy to \nmake sure it built value, not simply bulk.

The team first identified \nkey value drivers for each business. The managers estimated the impact on the value of each business of increasing sales growth  by 1 percent, raising margins by a point, and \nreducing capital intensity, while holding other factors in constant proportion. The results, shown in Exhibit 2.9, indicated th at the key factors varied by business. Foodco was \nmost sensitive to reductions in capital intensity and increased margins. At current margins and capital intensity, however, Foo dco's value would actually decrease if it grew \nfaster. Its growth would be unprofitable with Foodco earning a rate of return on invested capital less than its cost of capital . Woodco was most sensitive to improvements in \noperating margin, which he hoped would come about as a result of the consolidation of the companies. Consumerco was most sensit ive to sales growth. Because of \nConsumerco's high margin and outstanding capital utilization, each dollar of sales generated large profits and cash flows.\nThe team next assessed the prospects for each business to improve its performance. One approach it used was simply to compare e ach EG business with similar companies \nto gauge relative operating performance.

These analyses, coupled with the financial comparisons, showed \nthat it was reasonable to assume that some of EG's businesses could indeed be made to perform at much higher \nlevels.\nConsumerco, despite its already high operating margin, seemed to have room to increase revenue significantly \nwhile simultaneously earning eve\nr-higher margins:\n\u2022 The team discovered that Consumerco had been holding down research and development (R&D) and \nadvertising spending to generate cash for EG's diversification efforts and to buffer the impact of EG's poor \nperformance in other parts of its portfolio. Ralph's team believed that increased spending in the short term would lead to higher sales volumes of existing products, as well as the introduction of additional high-margin \nproducts to the marketplace.\n\u2022 Despite Consumerco's dominant position in its market categories, Consumerco's prices were actually lower \nthan less popular brands. The team's research showed that most category leaders were able to charge higher prices. The team estimated that the value created by price increases would more than offset expected volume losses.\n\u2022 Consumerco's salesforce was analyzed and the team found that it was less than half as productive as the \nsalesforces at other companies selling through the same channels. Ralph had suspected opportunities here and \nthe analysis confirmed that actions had to be taken to improve salesforce productivity.\n\u2022 The team determined that cost of goods sold, particularly purchases and inventory management, held \nadditional opportunities. The cost of sales could easily be reduced by one percentage point.\nWhen the team factored in these improvements, they found that Consumerco's value could conservatively be \nincreased by 25 percent, as shown on Exhibit 2.10.\nWoodco, the furniture division, also had the potential to improve its performance beyond plan by a large \nmargin, if it could transform itself and perform at the levels of other top companies in its industry. This would likely require a change in Woodco's strategy after the consolidation, to focus less on growth and more on \ndeveloping higher margins. To do this, Woodco would need to build management information and control \nsystems to keep a tighter rein on its businesses. Woodco would also need to consider sticking more to the basic, mass-market segment of the business where strong operating skills would provide an advantage. This would \nprobably involve abandoning plans to move the business up market. While prices were higher and the potential \nrewards great in this segment, design skills were of utmost importance. Woodco would be better off focusing on its potentially strong core in the mass-market, basic-furniture segment and maximizing its advantage and returns there. Competitors' performance bore this out.

Moreover, Foodco appeared to have no advantages to bui ld on. The Consumerco brand, which \nFoodco was using, was of little or no real value in building the business. Foodco would be unable to develop significant scale economies, at least in the near future. To make \nmatters worse, Foodco had a voracious appetite for capital to build facilities, but was not generating a return on new investme nt sufficient to cover the opportunity cost of the \ncapital. The team reckoned that the best strategy for Foodco almost certainly would involve cutting back to only its profitable  locations and being much more circumspect \nabout growth targets. Even then, it would be necessary to find some way to reduce the cost of capital employed in the Foodco bu siness, either through \nfranchising/management-contract approaches or substantially higher financial leverage. Otherwise, Foodco would likely remain an  insignificant contributor to building EG's \nvalue.\nSimilar reviews were carried out for the smaller EG businesses. The team also looked critically at EG's corporate overhead situ ation and concluded that opportunities existed \nto reduce costs substantially. EG's corporate staff had grown over the years. The divisions too had added staff to the point wh ere they were functioning largely as \nfreestanding operations. Ralph believed that 50 percent of the corporate costs could be eliminated.\nRalph concluded that the potential internal value of EG's businesses was at least $3.6 billion, which would be 50 percent above  its current market value (see Exhibit 2.11). \nThis was before considering any incremental value that might be garnered through the sale of particular EG businesses to owners  who might do more with them, as might be \nthe case with the relatively unattractive Foodco business.\nRalph and his team were beginning to feel better about their chances for turning EG into a high- performance company.

To Ralph's team, a number of the units did appear to be worth more for \ntheir alternative real estate value than in their current incarnation as restaurants. This did not hold true for Foodco as a whole; the company was worth more as a going concern than in liquidation. The review of \nFoodco's properties did suggest that management consider closing and selling some of those units, including \nsome that were profitable.\nOne business the team found might be worth more liquidated than operated was EG's small consumer finance \ncompany. Consumer finance had become so competitive that the spread between borrowing costs and the rates \nearned on new loans did not cover operating costs. The team discovered that the existing loan portfolio might \nbe sold for more than the entire business was worth. In effect, each year's new business was dissipating some o f \nthe value inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The team was also sure that it would be relatively easy to sell the portfolio to other financial companies and exit the business entirely.\nNo links between the finance company and any of the other EG businesses would need to be untangled. EG \nwould also consider the possibility of selling the entire business and searching for ways to make the company \nstronger, but it seemed likely that it would end up going out of business.\nReflecting on the values generated by a financially driven dismemberment of EG, Ralph saw clearly that the \ngains from pure financial maneuvering would be limited. The best combination of financial plays for each \nbusiness did not generate an increment over EG's current market value.\nFinally, Ralph reviewed the team's findings on the value of EG's parts to strategic buyers\u2014potential owners \nwho would be able to make the improvements required to increase the value of the businesses. From these analyses, it was evident that Consumerco, EG's largest business, might be worth much more in the hands of \nanother owner than it was now to EG even after Ralph achieved the potential value he had identified earlier. A \nstrategic buyer might see several sources of value in Consumerco. First was the ability to make the improvements to the growth and returns in the business Ralph's team had identified earlier. It was clear to Ralph that these opportunities were evident to any potential acquirer who looked at Consumerco, even using \npublicly available data. Important too was the potential for cost savings between the consumer businesses of \ncertain potential buyers and Consumerco. For instance, salesforces could be combined and much of Consumerco's direct salesforce eliminated. Potential savings could also be realized in the management of \nConsumerco itself, since it might be merged into an existing management structure at another consumer \nproducts company.\nIn addition to cost savings, an acquirer might believe it could improve Consumerco's business by injecting \nmore vigorous marketing know-how into the business and improving its new product development activities. \nRalph believed that these areas, while difficult to quantify, needed improvement at Consumerco, which was not \nknown for the strength of its marketing team. It had grown accustomed to the high returns its dominant and essentially unchallenged brand recognition provided to its range of products. All these factors together suggested that Consumerco might be worth more than $3.2 billion to a strategic buyer, which was much more \nthan it was currently worth as run by EG (around $2 billion).

Since Consumerco was a large portion of EG's v alue, the whole company was at risk of a \ntakeover by a buyer interested in getting its hands on Consumerco.\nPotential strategic buyers existed for the other EG businesses too, and Ralph's team did its best to estimate the value of the EG businesses to each company. The team \nthought Foodco would be attractive to another more established restaurant company that might follow one of two courses of actio n. On the one hand, it could accelerate \nFoodco's development and leverage its own management skills to improve the profitability of the Foodco units. Alternatively, it  could convert the Foodco sites to its own \nrestaurant concept. Foodco did have quite a few good locations. In fact, it looked as if EG would be better off selling Foodco,  since even after paying tax on the proceeds, the \nbusiness was unlikely to be worth as much under EG's plans.\nThe Woodco business might be attractive to one of several other companies in the industry that had earned a reputation for buyi ng and improving smaller furniture \ncompanies. But it made little sense to sell Woodco when it was in the midst of the consolidation. Any potential buyer would not  be willing to take the risk of having the \nbusiness fall apart in the transition to new ownership. For all practical purposes, the Woodco business would not be salable fo r 12 to 18 months at anything other than a \ndistressed price. By the end of 18 months, though, EG would be in a good position to evaluate a sale. The business would be str eamlined and Ralph would have a better idea \nabout the ability of Woodco's management to improve performance to that of the industry leaders. If Woodco could perform that w ell on its own, EG would be better off \nkeeping it, and perhaps using it as a base for making additional furniture company acquisitions. If Woodco did not look like it  could perform better, it could be sold for a \nmuch better price than today.\nExhibit 2.12 shows the conclusions the team drew about estimated values for the EG businesses under the scenarios. The team con cluded that, even allowing for difficulty in \nselling Woodco, EG could be worth substantially more than its current stock price if sold piece by piece to the best potential owners of each business.\nNew Growth Opportunities\nRalph liked the way the restructuring analysis was coming together.

Yet he knew that \ngreater long-term growth was imperative to keep managers and investors interested in the company. He also \nbelieved that there was tremendous untapped potential in Consumerco's brand name.\nThroughout Ralph's years with the company, it always struck him as odd that there was never much discussion \nabout incubating new businesses specifically linked to Consumerco. Radical moves like big acquisitions \nweren't discussed either. He needed to get long-term growth back on the agenda. A quick analysis showed that if he could find opportunities that generated $500 million to $1 billion in sales, he could increase the market \nvalue of Consumerco by $800 million or more. He knew the potential was there, but he wasn't sure yet what the \nideas would be. It could be global expansion, it could be new services for retail customers and going directly to the consumer.\nWith all that was on his plate, Ralph knew that his first priority was EG's restructuring, but he insisted on \nkeeping this long-term potential on the top of everyone's mind. He demanded that all the summary charts of \nthis restructuring analysis prominently display the long-term growth imperative. He was willing to wait six to \nnine months while the restructuring was under way, but then he had to act on growth.\nPotential Value of Financial En gineerin g\nRalph also urged his CFO to look hard at EG's financial structure and come up with an aggressive plan to take advantage of the tax advantages of debt financing. EG had had a policy of maintaining an AA rating from Standard & Poor's and liked to think of itself as a strong investment-grade company. Ralph knew that many \ncompanies had taken on much higher debt levels and performed well. The performance of many had been \nspectacular, as managers thought harder about how to generate additional cash flow and looked more critically at investment requirements and so-called fixed expenses.\nEG had sizable and stable free cash flows that could support much higher debt. The Consumerco business, \nwhich generated the bulk of the cash, was recession resistant. Ralph also knew that he did not need much \nreserve financial capacity given the relative maturity of EG's core business and its limited need for capital. He \nalso believed that EG would be able to get access to funding for a major expansion or acquisition, if it made economic sense.

As the financial performance of the EG businesses improved, EG would be \nable to carry an even higher debt load comfortably.

EG's price jumped \nimmediately when the plan was announced. Then, when investors saw that EG was taking the actions it had \npromised, the stock price rose further. Over the first six months of 1999, EG's shares increased more than 40 \npercentage points above the stock market average increase. The analysts who followed EG stopped talking about takeovers and applauded the ''transformation\" of the company.\nNeedless to say, Ralph and his team were pleased with the results. Ralph regretted having had to reduce the \ncorporate staff and sell some of EG's businesses, but took some comfort from the knowledge that he did it in a \nmore orderly and humane way than an outsider would have. Despite the successes, Ralph knew he had a lot more work ahead to see the restructuring plan through to completion, and needed to begin building an orientation toward managing value into the company. Otherwise, he feared that employees would become \ncomplacent about EG's performance, and the accumulation of untapped value potential would begin anew. He \nwanted to build on the fragile momentum he had established.\nRalph planned to take six steps to build EG's ability to manage value:1. Focus planning and business performance reviews around value creation.2. Develop value-oriented targets and performance measurement.3. Restructure EG's compensation system to foster an emphasis on creating shareholder value.4. Evaluate strategic investment decisions explicitly in terms of impact on value.5. Begin communication with investors and analysts more clearly about the value of EG's plans.\n6. Reshape the role of EG's CFO.\nRalph's plans and thinking in each of these areas are set out next. (Chapter 6, Making Value Happen,  provides a \nsystematic approach to carrying out these ideas.)\nPut Value into Plannin g\nRalph was convinced that one of the main reasons EG had gotten into trouble was a lack of focus on value creation in developing corporate-level and business-unit plans. Likewise, evaluations of the performance of the businesses had only a vague focus on value. Ralph firmly believed that it was the responsibility of all senior managers to focus on value creation. Ralph would ensure that company plans included a thorough analysis of \nthe value of each of the businesses under alternative scenarios. He would also make sure that EG used the \nrestructuring hexagon approach on an annual basis to identify any restructuring opportunities within EG's \nportfolio.\nThis new focus on value would also require some changes in the way EG thought about its corporate strategy. \nFor the next year or so, EG had to focus on", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2740, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "550c0732-53e9-4ea9-8a66-9d4c87e23ea8": {"__data__": {"id_": "550c0732-53e9-4ea9-8a66-9d4c87e23ea8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["EG"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2351375e-0076-46d9-ba83-fcb305d75913", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "b771644f67fb75ee4896bd2aa05602b0f9005e2ef13eef8bc33b265154f645e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "319e50ce-cd5d-4e9d-8259-b365ae07ec25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "564152423446f0ad582bc9219afd7b9082fc35bee84483d73ac172d5da5ff964", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d6911aaa-34bd-4d88-a272-e696694a4d61", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "002ed1c124aeeafd36f5ef9485dc38be344be41175bdd2f782cc0173147b119f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 37\nrestructuring. In the longer term, Ralph would need to develop a plan for sustaining EG's advantage in the \nmarket for corporate control. To do this, he would need to better understand the company's skills and assets and in which businesses they would be most valuable. Most important, he would have to ensure that the value of \nthese skills could be identified in terms of higher margins, growth rates, and the like before building action \nplans around them. Too often, Ralph was convinced, EG had done a perfunctory analysis of its capabilities and entered businesses without a clear idea of how and why EG would be a better owner and able to create value for its shareholders. As a first step, later in the year Ralph would establish a task force to compile an inventory \nand do an analysis of EG's skills and assets compared with its competition, as well as ideas for new businesses \nEG might enter.\nAt the business level, EG's new focus on value would require some changes too. The restructuring review had \npointed out a number of specific strategic and operating actions that the various business managers would need \nto take. Beyond this, management in the business units would need to think differently about their operations. \nThey would need to focus on what was driving the value of their businesses\u2014whether it was volume growth, margins, or capital utilization. Everyone was accustomed to focusing on growth in earnings, but what would \nmatter in the future would be growth in value and economic returns on investment. Sometimes this would mean \nforegoing growth in the business that would have been accepted in years gone by. At other times, managers would have to get more comfortable with the idea of reporting lower earnings when investment in research and development or advertising with a longer term payoff made economic sense. Ralph knew that these changes \nwould be difficult for his management group, because it had not been encouraged to think this way in the past. \nTo help bring about change, he decided to share with the management group the results of the corporate restructuring analysis and to develop a series of training seminars for senior division management about \nshareholder value.\nDevelop Value-Oriented Tar gets and Performance Measures\nRalph knew that his managers needed clear targets and performance measures to track their progress. While the \nstock price performance was the ultimate measure, he needed something more concrete and directly \nmanageable by his managers,particularly his business unit managers. He also knew that traditional accounting \nmeasures like net income ignored the opportunity cost of the capital tied up to generate earnings. Return on invested capital (ROIC), on the other hand, ignored value-creating growth. So he turned to a measure that \nincorporated both growth and return on invested capital, called economic profit (EP). EP is the spread between \nthe return on capital and its opportunity cost times the quantity of invested capital:\nRalph chose this measure because he knew that the discounted value of future economic profit (plus the current amount of invested capital) would equal the discounted cash flow (DCF) value (see Chapters 3 and 4 for a more complete", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 3250, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6911aaa-34bd-4d88-a272-e696694a4d61": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6911aaa-34bd-4d88-a272-e696694a4d61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["Ralph"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8fd51267-4214-4e4c-b861-205d5a41cdd4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "46bb0f05c67b088f105f2160b7011de347b830717a6ba5fb9546190643c005f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "550c0732-53e9-4ea9-8a66-9d4c87e23ea8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "608c5c1acce3dd33511d5c6af99d7c23c4d8d8b4b169677798f7de019b3983d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "053d374b-257c-492f-9e99-ce487e68c1d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "05e0ff1370631d03c1ab97e355ce635c9e529f401a493373fe0d9a716a28857e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 38\ndescription). In other words, EG could maximize DCF value by maximizing economic profit. Ralph asked that \nall strategic plans and budgets include economic profit targets for each of the business units.\nKnowing that lower level managers also needed targets and performance measures that they could directly \ninfluence, he asked his business unit managers to translate economic profit targets into specific operational \nperformance measures for their operating managers. For example, the manufacturing manager might be \nmeasured by cost per unit, quality, and meeting delivery schedules. Sales might be measured by sales growth, \nprice discounts of list prices, and selling costs as a percent of revenues.\nThis integrated system of target setting and performance measurement required a new mindset for Ralph's \naccounting group, which was accustomed to dealing with accounting results. The accounting group resisted but \nRalph convinced it of the benefits of integrating financial results with operating measures and with moving toward more economically relevant financial measures.\nTie Compensation to Value\nRalph believed that one of the most powerful levers he could use in building a value-creation focus throughout EG was the compensation system. At present, the package contained relatively little performance-based incentive for top managers. They did receive a bonus, but it was a relatively modest proportion of total \ncompensation. They also received stock options, but few viewed these as significant in terms of their ability to \nbuild capital for doing a good job. It was clear to Ralph that the top-management incentives did not focus on value creation. Bonus payouts were geared toward achievement of earnings-per-share targets, which as he \nknew did not always correlate well with creating value. In addition, the compensation of business-unit \nmanagers was tied more closely to the performance of EG as a whole than it was to the fortunes of their \nparticular business unit.\nRalph figured that several schemes were capable of meeting his objectives. He asked his human resources \nexecutives to consider phantom stock for each of the divisions; a deferred compensation program structured \naround the economic profit targets that the businesses were adopting, and using the attainment of goals on \nparticular value drivers as a basis for compensation awards.\nAssess Value of Strate gic Investments\nInjecting a value-creation focus into EG's planning and performance review process would make a big \ndifference. Ralph also knew he needed to make changes in the way the company looked at major spending \nproposals.\nTo evaluate capital spending, EG had been using discounted cash flow analysis for at least five years, as had \nmost other companies. This was fine, but Ralph saw two problems. First, capital spending was not linked \ntightly enough to the strategic and operating plans for the businesses. Because of this, capital spending proposals were out of context and difficult to evaluate. Second, EG had been using a corporatewide hurdle rate to assess capital investment proposals.

To make matters worse, the hurdle \nrate was too high, having been set in an attempt to smoke out unrealistic operating projections. The result was an ineffective capital spending process. Ralph figured that many investments that earned about the cost of \ncapital were being passed up because they did not meet EG's extremely high hurdle rate. On the other hand, \nmajor capital investments were not evaluated as closely as they should be since the whole process had degenerated into a numbers game about assumptions. Ralph intended to tie capital spending closely to strategic and operating plans to ensure that its evaluation was realistic and fact-based. He would also ensure that the \nfinance staff developed appropriate hurdle rates that would differ by division to reflect the relevant opportunity \ncost of capital.\nRalph knew that one of EG's biggest problems had been the evaluation of acquisitions. He knew they had paid \ntoo much for the Woodco acquisitions in the 1980s. In the restructuring review, he had seen the impact of \npaying too much on the company's share price. Fortunately, as CEO he would have direct control over the \ndecision to pursue acquisitions. He would insist that when proposing an acquisition, the relevant operating manager and CFO do a thorough valuation analysis based on cash flow returns for the transaction. He would \nnot make the mistake his predecessor had of believing that just because he could make the accounting earnings \nand dilution figures look good in the first year or two of an acquisition, it made sense from a value standpoint.\nTo Ralph it was really quite simple. Either the cash flow value to EG's shareholders of an acquisition would be \nhigher than the price EG would have to pay, or Ralph would not make the acquisition. And he believed that value could be assessed much more systematically than in the past.\nFirst, EG management would evaluate the target's business on an ''as is\" basis, just as the team had done for \nEG. Next, management would use the restructuring hexagon approach to identify improvements that could be made to the value of the company on a stand-alone basis. The management of the target company might or might not be capable of making these improvements on its own. Third, EG management would evaluate the \npotential for synergies with other EG businesses on a systematic basis. These synergies would be evaluated in \nconcrete terms for their impact on value. Finally, EG management would think about the strategic options the acquisition would create. These would be difficult to evaluate and value, but could nevertheless be important. \nFor example, an acquisition might give EG an option on a new technology in one of its businesses, or access to \na new market, both of which could have substantial value under the right conditions.\nArmed with this information, Ralph would be much better able to evaluate the logic of any acquisition, \ncertainly much clearer than EG management had ever been. He would know how much EG could afford to pay. Equally important, he would know more specifically what to do with the business after it had been acquired. \nBefore entering negotiations, Ralph would also have his team assess the value of the target to other potential \nacquirers; in this way he could be sure that he would not enter into a fruitless bidding contest or end up buying the company at a price higher than he needed to. He certainly did not want to fall into the trap of giving all the \npotential value of the candidate to the selling shareholders. After all, why should EG do all the work and the \nsellers receive all the rewards?", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 3709, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4002ece-47fb-4d28-bec3-4fbedb04da31": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4002ece-47fb-4d28-bec3-4fbedb04da31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["Wall Street", "Develop Investor Communications Strate gy"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "243d55ec-79e7-4f98-aca4-013a7b71d381", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "970f7a913a0b3ceb4df82fd2c9eebb25a0803138788b546569f3d66f04bca917", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "053d374b-257c-492f-9e99-ce487e68c1d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "689b4675fd2f8f53e42fbcf4286cbd03ec9dba09dfaddd3b8266fcefe6ca8802", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1b467e0d-f07a-4076-b3d7-ffb2b734c3f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "354965ca600898ddc09eb34488ea8b6347afffd13a39dfbd8d50c923a89fd783", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 40\nAcquisition proposals would be subjected to a new test. EG management would no longer presume that the best \nway to pursue a new business idea was by acquisition. Ralph would ensure that management considered entering a business in other ways, such as through a joint venture. Such approaches might be alternatives to the \n''big bang\" acquisitions that seem like easy solutions at the time, but afterward cause endless problems for the \ncompany's stock market performance.\nDevelop Investor Communications Strate gy\nRalph planned to continue working hard to build the company's credibility with Wall Street analysts and investors. It would be essential for EG to track analyst views on its performance and prospects on a regular basis. Ralph wanted to do this for two reasons. First, he would be able to ensure that the market had sufficient information to evaluate the company at all times. Second, Ralph knew that the market was smart. He could \nlearn a lot about the direction of his industry and competitors from the way investors evaluated his shares and \nthose of other companies. He did not believe that he could, nor would he try, to fool the market about EG. He was convinced that it was sound strategy to treat investors and the investing community with the same care that \nthe company showed its customers and employees. Had previous management taken the time to understand \nwhat the market was saying about EG, the company might have avoided the difficult position in which it found itself.\nIn addition to tracking the analysts' opinions and meeting with them regularly, Ralph thought EG should be \nmore active and clearer in communicating with investors. Henceforth, communications with the market at \nsecurities analyst meetings and in press releases would focus on what EG was doing to build value for \nshareholders. He even thought it might be a good idea to have a section in the annual report entitled \"Perspective on the Value of Your Company\" that would discuss the company's strategy for creating value.\nHe thought that EG could go as far as publishing estimates of the value of the company, as long as the \nassumptions were spelled out clearly. Ralph knew that this communications strategy would be a break with the \npractices of many companies and with EG's recent past. However, Ralph did not really think investors got much benefit from the mechanical\u2014and usually vague\u2014explanations of changes in year-to-year performance \ntypically found in annual reports. Likewise, the glossy photographs and glowing language in the front sections \nof many annual reports did little to give investors a clear sense of where a company was going and what the status of their investment was.\nReshape CFO's Role\nCritical to the success of Ralph's efforts to build a value-creation focus into EG was the need to upgrade the role of the CFO. It was clear to Ralph that the link between business strategy and financial strategy was becoming tighter. Corporate strategies, which are designed to create an advantage in the market for corporate \ncontrol and financial markets, are by definition intertwined with financial considerations.

It would require the recruitment of the new EVP and substantial time and attention from Ralph himself. Focusing planning and performance measurement on value creation, evaluating all major decisions in \nterms of impact on value, redesigning the compensation system for senior management, and communicating \nmore clearly and consistently with the stock market would help to ensure that EG maintained an advantage in the market for corporate control and produced outstanding value for shareholders. Moreover, by following this much more integrated approach, it would be easier for EG to set corporate priorities, since major decisions \nwould be brought back to the common benchmark of their impact on the value of the company.\nSummary\nThe ability to manage value is an essential part of developing sound corporate and business strategies\u2014\nstrategies that create value for shareholders and maintain an advantage in the market for corporate control. As the case of EG Corporation shows, managing value is not a mysterious process. Valuation techniques and \napproaches can be complex in their details, but are relatively straightforward in their objectives and \napplications. Our objective in the balance of this book is to demystify the approaches needed to carry out value management in most companies.\nAs in the EG case, managing value consists of three broad steps: taking stock  of the value-creation situation \nwithin the company and identifying restructuring opportunities; acting  on those opportunities, which usually \ninvolves major transactions such as divestitures and acquisitions as well as reorganization of the company, and \ninstilling  a value-creation philosophy in the company.\nA managing-value focus does not create value through financial manipulations. Rather, it creates value through \ndeveloping sound strategic and operating plans for a company's businesses. The link between sound strategy \nand value creation is a tight one. As many CEOs have learned, financial manipulation on its own seldom \nworks.\nMany companies are not in as desperate a condition as we outlined for EG. Most companies, however, would \nbenefit from a thorough review of restructuring opportunities. Perhaps it is because many companies that have \ngone through massive restructuring believe that it will only happen once. As we discussed in Chapter 1, we \nbelieve that restructuring and an active market for corporate control are now facts of corporate life. Consequently, managers need to ensure that they identify and act on value-creation opportunities regularly\u2014not just once when they are a takeover target. This is best done through fundamental changes in the way their \nbusinesses are structured and operated. By acting now, value managers can avoid the need to react under \nduress.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2917, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8aad8fe-1bb6-41db-9539-2619dcb26122": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8aad8fe-1bb6-41db-9539-2619dcb26122", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["Fred 's Superhardware", "Fred 's Furniture and Fred 's Garden Supplies", "Fred 's Hardware"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14a583e9-fedb-4660-9cf4-66d215ab4eb5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "481a5ac9e38935e22a93729bc246acfbbbae8854485dceb5c6964e04be596e87", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "64404555-6edb-4e4c-ba41-94db87b777e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "782057b30015e172ee9cce9ad6920d609674cf2e168d6c62f2718d4179550228", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca89d9b2-2959-41e3-8fac-ee7504e941ee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf1b809a645f254725b8b3d1467e462a66f854ba6f4bf2cca0142c81079e94aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 47\n3\u2014 \nFundamental Principles of Value Creation\nTo effectively measure and manage the value of a company, you need to understand the \nfundamental principles of value creation.

We told him that what he should care about is not the ROIC itself, but the \ncombination of ROIC (versus cost of ca pital) and the amount of ca pital, ex pressed as economic profit. We showed him a sim ple exam ple (Exhibit 3.1 ).\nEconomic profit can be expressed as the spread between ROIC less the cost of capital, multiplied by the amount of invested capi tal. In Fred's case, \neconomic profit was $800,000. If he closed down his low returning store, average ROIC would increase, but economic profit would  decline.

His \nSuperhardware concept was very successful and he came to us again with great ambitions. I need to \nbuild more stores, so I need more capital, Fred said. Besides, I want to provide an opportunity for \nsome of m y employees to become owners. So I have decided to go public. What's going to ha ppen?\nWell, we said, now you need to learn the distinction between financial markets and real markets and \nhow they are related to each other. We need to teach you that good performance in one market does \nnot necessaril y mean good performance in another.\nUntil now, we have been talking about the real market: How much profit and cash flow are you \nearning relative to the investments you have to make? Are you maximizing your economic profit and cash flow? In the real market your decision rule is simple: Choose strategies or make \no\nperational decisions that maximize the present value of future cash flow or future economic profit.\nWhen a company enters the financial (or capital market), the real market decision rules are \nessentially unchanged, but life gets more complicated because management must simultaneously \ndeal with the financial market.\nWhen a company goes public (sells shares to a wide range of investors who can trade those shares in \nan organized market), the interaction (or trading activity) between investors and speculators sets a price for those shares. The price of the shares is based on what investors think  those shares are \nworth. Each investor decides what he thinks the value of the shares should be and trades based on \nwhether the current \nprice is above or below his estimate of the intrinsic value.\nThis intrinsic value is based on the future cash flows or earnings power of the company. This means, \nessentially, that investors are paying for the performance that they expect the company to achieve in \nthe future, not what the company has done in the past and certainly not the cost of the assets in the com\npany.\nFred then asked the question, ''How much will we get when we sell our shares?\" Let's assume that \nthe market's overall assessment of your company's future performance is similar to what you think \nyour com pany will do. So the first ste p is to forecast your com pany's performance and discount\n1 See Chapter 8 for a detailed discussion of the DCF and economic profit valuation approaches.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2641, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d5265ea-33ac-4299-b430-5d2245a3697d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d5265ea-33ac-4299-b430-5d2245a3697d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["Fred"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1a239d29-b291-446a-91d7-b056955e5ba4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "dff23d97262545002a46173e15408396030e4f59d8b8157b8ff4e6d2004f8281", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "77ed4da4-041f-42c1-8f0b-cfd7373783ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "0b557e2a3d210bd3145ed1050ca3b93a3a6a951720e66f97ae9bcbaf9ee64702", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4ea0699-d0c5-4fb0-8703-77e34069d85e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eea4d545f6f75036ea10e07697a04f7c38fbe5360fad989b769780652a6d8edf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 52\nthe future expected cash flows. Based on this analysis, the intrinsic value of your shares is $20 per \nshare.\nThat's interesting, Fred said, because the amount of capital I have invested is only $7 per share. We \nresponded, that means the market should be willing to pay you a premium of $13 over the invested capital for the future economic profit that you will earn. But if they pay me this premium up front, \nhe asked, how will the investors make an\ny mone y?\nThey may not, we said. Let's see what happens if your company performs exactly as expected by \nyou and the market. Let's value the com pany in five years.\nThe value of the company in five years will be $32 per share, if you perform exactly as you \nanticipate and expectations beyond five years don't change. Let's assume that you have not paid any dividends. So an investor who bought a share for $20 per share today could sell the share for $32 in five years. The annualized return would be 10 percent, exactly the same as the discount rate we used \nto discount your future performance. The interesting thing is that as long as you perform as \nex\npected, the return for your shareholders will be e qual to their o pportunit y cost.\nIf, on the other hand, you did better then expected, your shareholders would earn more than 10 \npercent. If you did worse than ex pected, your shareholders would earn less than 10 percent.\nInvesting in the stock market is like betting on sports teams. When you bet on American football, \nyou bet based on a market-determined point spread. If you bet on the favorite, they not only have to win the game for your bet to pay off, they have to win by more points than the spread. In other words, the favorite has to win b\ny more points than ex pected for their su pporters to win their bets.\nSo, Fred said, the return that investors earn is driven not by the performance of my company but by \nthe performance relative to expectations. Exactly, we said. That means I have to manage my company's performance in the real markets and the financial markets at the same time? Exactly, we \nsaid. If you create lots of value in the real market (by earning more than your cost of capital and \ngrowing fast) but don't do as well as investors expect, they will be disappointed. Your task as manager is to maximize the intrinsic value of the company and to properly manage the expectations of the financial market.\nManaging the expectations of the market is tricky. You don't want their expectations to be too high \nor too low. We have seen companies convince the market that they will deliver great performance and then not deliver on those promises. Not only does the share price drop when the market realizes that the company will not be able to deliver, but it may take years for the company to regain \ncredibility with the market.

But we think \nthat the debate over which metric to use has come unstuck from the real purpose of metrics: to help managers make value-creating decisions and to orient all company employees toward value creation.\nAttempts to compare metrics that have different goals just lead to confusion. DCF and economic \nprofit, for example, are not alternatives. DCF collapses performance across time into a single result and is used for strate\ngic anal ysis. Economic profit is a short-term financial indicator.\nSome metrics are indeed better than others. We prefer economic measures (such as economic profit) \nto accounting-based measures (such as earnings per share). First, empirical research suggests that cash flow, not accounting earnings, is what drives share price performance. Second, it's easier to understand short versus long-term tradeoffs when you use an economic measure. Finally, you can \nbetter understand the sources of value if you use economic measures.\nHowever, there is no perfect performance measure. As a result, we use a framework that links \nvarious economic measures to describe different aspects of performance (Exhibit 4.1). The \nframework describes which combinations of measures are useful for each aspect and also explains \nhow different measures relate to each other.\n1 Economic profit is a generic term synonymous with Stern Stewart's metric EVATM.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 1713, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7dd5ad62-c32c-4c6d-b9f1-7c7ff3820b52": {"__data__": {"id_": "7dd5ad62-c32c-4c6d-b9f1-7c7ff3820b52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "55891a07-dd11-40b5-b60e-80d8766a585f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "89f0960624d5e7e6b4684a00f2feee9577749604adb9e0af11d3b83530688e60", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ace4e76-b071-4878-8a18-b8a0511caeba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "7a9dca64c425a75617adb23b3154cb1c4e8648904bb57ad7319d42fff14bf999", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aaa3b722-32f4-40b4-9e56-95d1751931b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30da4de418ca181ae268e9dc805675c1b24186c09aa01c60bb1cf3c89bd9d96d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 56\nExhibit 4.1 Comprehensive Value Metrics Framework\n \nReviewing Exhibit 4.1 starting from the left, the ultimate output measure is shareholder value \ncreation in the stock market. Since it is an output measure, managers cannot use it for decision makin\ng, but the y can set shareholder value creation tar gets.\nShareholder value creation in the stock market must be linked to some measure of intrinsic value. \nIntrinsic value is ultimately driven by the long-term cash-flow-generating ability of the company. Hence, intrinsic value can be measured by discounted cash flow (DCF). Intrinsic value based on DCF can be used to evaluate specific investment opportunities or the strategy of a business unit or an entire com\npany.\nWhile a valuable tool for strategic analysis, DCF values cannot be used to evaluate historical \nperformance because they are based on projections. Another drawback of DCF values is that they are difficult to assess in the abstract. But DCF value can be linked to important financial indicators. \nThe financial drivers of cash flow and DCF value are growth (in revenues and profits) and return on \ninvested ca\npital (relative to a com pany's cost of ca pital).\nBecause short-term financial measures may signal changes in value creation too late, we also need \nto use operating and strategic measures, called value drivers. Monitoring these drivers helps avoid \nsacrificing long-term value creation for short-term financial results.

Analysis of total shareholder \nreturns for a sample of nearly 400 companies showed that market and sector movements explained \non avera ge more than 40 percent of the returns durin g any one- or three- year period.\nIt follows that if performance is measured on the basis of TRS alone, managers are in effect being \npartially rewarded or penalized for events outside their control (this can be alleviated by using TRS \nrelative to a market or sector index). Yet traditional share option schemes do just that, and the bull \nmarket of the 1990s rewarded option-holding employees in all but the most woefully underperforming companies. The other side of the coin is a growing problem for the volatile high-technology industry. When a sector re-rating made share prices plummet, companies found they had to re\nprice em ployee share-o ption packages to retain im portant staff.\nIn fact, in the short term, differences between actual performance and market expectations and \nchanges in these expectations drive share prices more than the level of performance per se. It is the delivery of surprises that produces higher or lower total shareholder returns compared to the market. \nAs a result, companies that consistently meet high performance expectations can find it hard to \ndeliver high TRS. The market may believe that management is doing an outstanding job, but its a\npproval has alread y been factored into the share price.\nOne way to understand the problem is by analogy to a treadmill. The speed of the treadmill \nrepresents the expectations for future financial performance implicit in the share price. If managers \nare able to beat these expectations, they accelerate the treadmill and so deliver above-average shareholder returns. As performance improves, the expectations treadmill turns more quickly. The better managers perform, the more the market expects from them; they have to pound the treadmill ever faster \njust to kee p up.\nFor outstanding companies, the treadmill is moving faster than for anyone else. It is difficult for \nmanagement to deliver at the expected level without faltering. Accelerating the treadmill will be hard. Continuin\ng to accelerate the treadmill will eventuall y become im possible.\nThis explains why extraordinary managers may deliver only ordinary share price increases in the \nshort run. If their compensation is based significantly on TRS through stock options, they are likely to be insufficiently rewarded. This predicament illustrates the old saw about the difference between a good company and a good investment: In the short term, good companies may not be good \ninvestments, and vice versa.\nIn the case of companies of which less is expected, TRS-driven measures may overcompensate \nmanagers. During the early years of a turnaround, for example, beating expectations may be \nrelatively easy because the expectations treadmill is not moving fast. Since the market reflects \nchanges in the performance expected in all future years, the net effect is that managers can deliver hi\ngh TRS even when the y have im proved performance onl y marginally.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 3166, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ac28a86-dc8f-4b07-9b03-3c748d3157a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ac28a86-dc8f-4b07-9b03-3c748d3157a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["Lukas Muehlemann", "Credit Suisse"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f18acbd-b194-46fb-a53e-3ea13ee0c027", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "96d70280160a03f4dbe8f8de9e737e8b0ed03e5281dece4b4c51edc0408417d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "62de7f12-93e0-4f17-ac79-a8191839c84b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "4d6c79b9c54aa4abe19470ac60b5e811ace377ad9c06dd8029228a385f543c9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c6a0bdf-40e2-4534-99aa-ceefb08f9a51", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "28c93976cf3ae0564c05a0d108a6377d4fc9fccf83fc8925b55f6d19930e5124", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 59\nThere is a considerable multiplier effect when the market re-rates a company to reflect higher \nexpectations.

MVA \nis calculated as the difference between the market value of a company's debt and equity and the \namount of capital invested. The market-to-capital ratio, a variation on MVA expressed as a ratio rather than a dollar amount, is the market capitalization of a company's debt and equity divided by the amount of ca\npital invested.\nMVA and market-to-capital ratio pose definition and measurement problems because they use \naccounting data. They are also subject to some of the same criticisms as TRS, namely that important elements of the valuation are outside of management's control. But they provide a worthy com\nplement to TRS b y measurin g different as pects of a com pany's performance.\nTRS can be likened to the speeding up or slowing down of the treadmill. It measures performance \nagainst the expectations of financial markets and changes in these expectations. TRS is a measure of how well a company beats the target set by market expectations\u2014a measure of improvement, in other words. MVA and market-to-capital, on the other hand, can be likened to the current speed of \nthe treadmill. They measure the financial market's view of future performance relative to the capital \ninvested in the business. In this wa\ny, they assess a com pany's absolute level of performance.\nTo understand the difference between MVA and TRS, consider the example of the U.S. retailers \nSears and Wal-Mart. In the five years ending December 31, 1997, Sears achieved an average TRS o f \n22 percent a year, while Wal-Mart managed 5 percent a year. Is Sears creating more value?

In other words, ever y dollar that Wal-Mart had \ninvested was valued b y the market at $3.20, while ever y dollar Sears had invested was valued at $1.40.\nWal-Mart creates more value, so it has a high market-to-capital.

Most people would pay more for Shortlife, because most people prefer to have cash now rather than later. Note \nthat the total cash flow over the entire six-year period is the same for both companies, though Shortlife shareholders get thei r cash earlier. In fact, if you \ndiscounted these cash flows to the beginning of year 1 at 10 percent, you would see that the present value of Shortlife's cash flow ($323) is about 50 \npercent larger than the present value of Longlife's cash flows ($212). This example illustrates the earnings-multiple approach' s main weakness. If you \nlook only at earnings, and ignore the capital required to generate the earnings, you cannot see that Shortlife should be valued  at a higher earnings \nmultiple than Longlife.

This approach is widely used by companies to evaluate capital spending proposals.

Like most things that stand the test of time, it works well in certain situa tions. When earnings \nreflect cash flow (e.g., businesses with little capital such as software companies), the approach provides a good proxy for dis counted cash flow. It is \nwhen earnin gs and cash flow diver ge that earnin gs multi ples come u p short.\nSuppose Longlife Company has figured out a way to increase its earnings each year by 10 percent by increasing invested capital at the same rate. The \nearnings-multiple approach and DCF analysis would suggest that the value of Longlife should increase by 10 percent as well, bec ause both earnings \nand cash flow increase b y 10 percent each year. So the earnin gs-multi ple approach would a ppear to value Lon glife correctl y.\nNow suppose that Longlife's controller can increase the first year's earnings by 10 percent by recording some revenues in year o ne that would otherwise \nappear in year two (but without actually changing the timing of cash flows). The increase in year one's earnings is exactly off set by the decrease in year \ntwo's. The most extreme accounting approach would say that the value of Longlife has increased by 10 percent. The DCF model wou ld not be fooled. \nCash flow has not chan ged, so Lon glife's value would be unchan ged in the DCF model.\nBefore maligning the earnings-multiple approach too much, we should show how to develop a more sophisticated model that mimics the DCF model \nwell under some circumstances. This entails finding a way to incorporate the quality of earnings into the P/E ratio so that we can differentiate between \ncompanies with identical earnin gs but different cash flows or risks.\nLet's construct another simple example, using Value Inc. and Volume Inc., as shown in Exhibit 4.7.

Using some algebra that \nhelps us deal with growing perpetuities, we can compute the value of Value Inc. to be $1,500 and \nVolume Inc. to be $1,000. This also means that Value Inc. has a P/E ratio of 15 and Volume Inc. of \n10.\nThe key to Value Inc.'s larger cash flow and higher value is that it does not invest as much capital to \ngenerate additional earnings. For example, Value Inc. invests only $25 in the first year to generate \n$5 additional earnings the next year, while Volume Inc. invests $50 to generate the same incremental earnings.

Unfortunately, short-term cash flows \nthemselves are not good performance measures. The cash flow in any year (or short period of years) is meaningless and easy to manipulate. A company can delay capital spending or cut back on advertising or research to improve short-term cash flow. Large negative cash flow is not a bad thing \nif the com\npany is investin g to generate even lar ger cash flows.\nMost importantly, cash flows are not intuitive. You can't look at a series of historical or projected \ncash flows and say what that means. What drives cash flow, as we commented earlier, is the growth of the company (revenues and earnings) and return on invested capital. This is the third issue in our \nmetrics framework.\nUsing ROIC and growth helps to understand how the levers of value creation may have different \nimpact depending on the current position of businesses.

In this chapter, we present evidence that the market does indeed work the way the theor\ny suggests.\nThe evidence falls into four cate gories:\n1. Changes in value (i.e., total returns to shareholders) are linked more closely to changes in \nexpectations than to absolute performance.\n2. Valuation levels (i.e., market/book ) are linked to return on invested ca pital and growth.\n3. The market sees throu gh cosmetic earnin gs effects and focuses on underl ying economic results.\n4. The market puts great wei ght on lon g-term results, not just short-term performance.\nAt the end of this chapter, we discuss the running debate about whether the stock market is efficient \nand the implications for management behavior. We conclude that even if the market does demonstrate inefficiencies, they are mostly small and short term. As a result, managers should \nbehave as if the markets were quite efficient.\nTRS Linked to Chan ges in Expectations\nIn Chapter 4, we made the case that total returns to shareholders are linked more to performance \nagainst expectations than absolute levels of performance. For example, on October 15, 1997, Intel \nreported that its earnings were up 19 percent compared with the previous year. Intel's share price \ndeclined 6.3 percent on the announcement because analysts had forecast a 23 percent increase in earnings. Over horizons of at least 15 years, TRS will be linked to earnings because earnings growth will track cash flow and returns on capital. Over shorter periods, however, we would expect \nperformance a gainst ex pectations to be more im portant for TRS than the level of earnin gs growth.\nWe conducted a statistical analysis of TRS against various performance measures.

Many managers \nseem obsessed with reported earnings. Yet, the evidence is clear: The market looks much deeper \nthan re ported earnin gs.\nThe simplest piece of evidence comes from companies that use different accounting methods \ndepending on the market in which they are reporting financial results. Hoechst was one of the largest German industrial companies, with over DM 50 billion in revenues in 1997. Hoechst listed \nits shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996, and was required to report financial results \nusing U.S. accounting standards. Until then, it had only reported results under German accounting rules. Here is a com\nparison of its re ported net income under the two standards:\nYearGerman \naccounting (DM \nmillion )U.S. accounting \n(DM million )Difference \n(percent )\n1995 1,709 (57) NM\n1996 2,114 1,324 \u201337\n1997 1,343 377 \u201372\nIf the market just looked at reported earnings, which would it use? It wouldn't use either one, it \nwould have to look dee per than re ported earnin gs.\nA classic area of research on this topic is inventory accounting. U.S. tax authorities require that the \nmethod used for financial reporting also be used for calculating taxable income. As a result, the \nchoice of accounting method affects both earnings and cash flow, but in opposite directions. In periods of rising prices, the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory method results in lower earnings than the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, because the cost of goods sold is based on more recent, higher \ncosts. Lower earnings mean lower income taxes. Since the pretax cash flow is the same regardless \nof the accounting method, LIFO accounting leads to a higher after-tax cash flow than FIFO accountin\ng, despite the lower re ported earnin gs.\nA number of researchers have looked at the stock price reaction of companies that have switched \nfrom one accounting method to the other. The accounting model suggests that switching from FIFO \nto LIFO should result in a lower share price because investors would anticipate lower reported earnin\ngs.\nWhile the evidence is not conclusive, some researchers have found that switching from FIFO to \nLIFO results in a hi gher share price.

If the market sees through goodwill, then price-earnings multiples should be much higher for companies with lots of goodwill amortization relative to other companies. This is because goodwill amortization reduces earnings, yet is not a cash charge. On the \nother hand, valuation multiples based on a cash flow measure like EBITDA (earnings before \ninterest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) should be in the same range as other companies in the same industry. The authors examined 3,633 companies and found that, as expected, companies with \ngoodwill had hi gher PE ratios but not hi gher EBITDA multi ples.\nAn interesting example of the goodwill issue was the 1995 acquisition of First Interstate Bank by \nWells Fargo.6 One analyst was quoted as saying that the \"Wells offer was futile\" because it would \nbe accounted for as a purchase, while a competing bid from First Bank System had the advantage of a pooling of interests. But the market ignored the conventional view of the analyst and chose Wells \nFargo's bid despite $400 million per year of goodwill amortization. In fact, Wells Fargo's share price \nwent up 3 percent on the day it was announced that its bid had prevailed and more than 20 percent durin\ng the next 10 tradin g days.\nThe other side of the coin is the story of AT&T's acquisition of NCR in 1991. Lys and Vincent \nconcluded that AT&T incurred additional costs of $500 million to get NCR to agree to terms that \nwould allow the telephone giant to do pooling accounting (primarily by agreeing to pay a higher price in exchange for NCR's removing obstacles to pooling). The authors estimated that the market value of AT&T fell by $4 billion to $6 billion during the merger negotiations.\n7 You could infer that \nAT&T's insistence on pooling made the market even more skeptical about the value creation \npotential of the transaction.\n5 These actions are prohibited for several years under pooling accounting.\n6 M.

We would argue that even if the market is occasionally inefficient, \nmana gers should make business decisions as if the market were efficient.\nIt has been more than 30 years since the concept of efficient markets was proposed. It is one of the \nmost debated and researched ideas in economics, if not all the social sciences. Yet it is also one of the most misunderstood. Many business people believe that the theory of efficient markets means \nthat the stock market always ''gets it right.\" The ambitions of efficient markets theory are much \nmore modest. In layman's terms, a market is efficient if new information is quickly or instantaneously reflected in share prices. Essentially, this means that it is hard for investors to beat the market unless they have better information than the market as a whole. Trading-oriented strate\ngies, such as momentum tradin g, are unlikel y to generate market- beatin g returns.13\nEver since academics suggested that the stock market behaves efficiently, researchers have been looking for anomalies to refute the thesis. While the debate is unresolved, it is fair to say that some anomalies have been identified. The question relevant for us is what are the implications of market \ninefficiencies for investors and cor\nporate mana gers.\nFor investors, it is clear that this represents an opportunity to make money. To exploit these \ninefficiencies, however, requires massive computing power and the ability to execute stock trades instantly. As with most market inefficiencies, only the biggest and quickest investors are likely to \nbenefit. In any case, once these inefficiencies become known, they usually disappear and the search \nis on for new ones.\nWhat are the implications for corporate managers? As long as your company's share price returns to \nits long-run DCF value, you might as well use the DCF approach for strategic decisions. What \nshould matter is the long-term behavior of the company's share price, not whether it is 5 percent \nundervalued this week.\nIf you can systematically identify when your company's stock is misvalued, you could try to use that \ninformation to determine when to sell more shares (or use shares to pay for an acquisition) or buy \nback shares. But for strategic business decisions, the evidence strongly suggests that the market acts more like it is usin\ng the DCF a pproach than the accountin g approach.\n13 For an excellent summary of the history and current debate, see R.

Our \nhypothesis is that in many companies, value-based management is taken up as a one-time project \nand not translated into lon g-term chan ges, with the effect that results are limited.\nThe central issue isn't whether companies have a special program called value-based management; \nrather, value results from a set of interrelated activities that most companies already have in place. \nThe point is to what extent these activities are done in ways that lead to value creation, and to what \nextent values and behaviors that promote value creation are a part of ''how we do things around here.\" This chapter describes what a company that actively manages for value would look and feel like, as well as how a com\npany interested in achievin g a high level of performance can get started.\nThe prerequisite for making value happen is that a company's actions build on a foundation of value \nthinkin g. Value thinkin g in turn has two dimensions\u2014value metrics and value mindset.\nThe central question of value metrics  is whether management really understands how companies \ncreate value and how the stock market values companies. Does management balance long- and \nshort-term results, or focus on short-term results only? Is the opportunity cost of capital included in the measurement? Are the metrics based on economic results or on accounting results? Chapters 3 and 4 detailed an economics-\nbased view of value creation metrics.\nValue mindset  refers to how much management cares about shareholder value creation. This \nmindset expresses itself in several crucial areas of the CEO's thinking and behavior. One aspect is whether the CEO truly seeks to create as much shareholder value as possible, as opposed to creating as much as is needed to quiet restive shareholders. Another aspect is whether the CEO sees managing for shareholder value as a way of life or just as a short-term project. Sir Brian Pitman, \nchairman of Lloyds TSB Group, introduced the target of doubling the bank's share price every three \nyears in the 1980s, and was quoted in 1998 as saying, \"We are willing to go on changing in order to double the value of the company\u2014to stretch ourselves beyond the things that we are doing at the moment.\"\n1\nFinally, the value-driven CEO is willing to make unpopular decisions if these are the choices that will maximize shareholder value in the long run. Pfizer, for example, was strongly criticized by analysts in the late 1980s for its high level of research and development spending. When this R&D spending translated into blockbuster drug sales in the 1990s, the market rewarded Pfizer's patience \nwith one of the highest valuations of any pharmaceutical company.

All too often, a \ncompany's externally communicated goals represent just an incremental increase over historical performance, and may link more to accounting measures such as earnings per share than to more economically based measures. Equally, its internally communicated goals, as embodied in a mission \nor vision statement, may have nothing to do with what people actually try to achieve on a day-to-\nda\ny basis.\nA company wishing to make value happen needs to develop an aspiration that combines two \ndimensions: an ins pirational statement of intent and value-linked quantitative tar gets.\nAn Inspirational Statement o f Inten t\nFor most companies, stating that their goal is to maximize shareholder value is not enough to excite employees, focus organizational energy, or direct their long-term ambitions. Thus, companies often \ndevelop broader statements of purpose. A good example is Disney, whose mission is ''To offer \nquality entertainment that people will seek out\" and whose vision is \"To create shareholder value by continuing to be the world's premier entertainment company from a creative, strategic, and financial stand\npoint.\"\nA statement of intent will only excite and unite stakeholders if it is perceived to reflect how \nmanagement actually acts day-to-day. Otherwise it may even be counterproductive, if employees then suspect the other elements of making value happen to be equally insincere. Therefore it is important for companies' statements to reflect a raison d'\u00eatre that the entire organization can identify \nwith and support. Examples of causes that can really inspire passionate support are to save the \ncompany from an imminent crisis; to defeat another competitor; to build something new; to serve a noble purpose, or to create wealth. To be practical, the aspiration should also answer the questions: What business(es) are we in and what do we aspire to be known for? Finally, the aspiration should \nbe written in a lan guage that people can relate to, avoidin g lofty or abstract phrasin gs.\nA Value-Linked Quantitative Tar get\nCompanies need to mark the milestones toward their aspiration with value-linked targets. Some \ncompanies target their share price, promising to double it in three, four, or five years.

Reverse-engineering the \nexpectations of future growth and return on invested capital implicit in a company's share price can \nprovide a perspective on this to pic, as can reviewin g equity anal ysts' re ports.2\n2. Targets should also take the industry context into account, both to get a fact base for what \nopportunities exist in the relevant markets and to understand what com petitors are likel y to achieve.\n3. Finally, great companies can serve as role models,  both in terms of the kinds of targets they set \nand the records that the y have achieved.\nBuilding on these analyses, the CEO and other top managers need to examine their own goals for \nthe company, being sure to challenge any limiting beliefs in their current thinking. The top team \nalso needs to calibrate the proposed targets against historical performance to observe how large a gap needs to be closed. Ideally, targets should provide some degree of stretch, but not so much as to undermine morale.\nBy combining the hard dimension of hitting financial numbers with the softer dimension of \nappealing to people's hearts and minds, aspirations can provide an overarching motivation for makin\ng value ha ppen.\nMana ging the Corporate Portfolio\nTo maximize value, a company must determine to what extent its current portfolio of businesses \nwill help it meet its aspirations. Building a portfolio is not just a financial exercise, since shareholders can buy and sell shares of various companies to get the reward/risk tradeoff they prefer. Instead, it is a combination of exploiting the strategic advantages of the corporation, \nrelentlessly looking for performance improvement opportunities, and managing a growth pipeline. \nThree \nperspectives on portfolio mana gement follow.\nStrategy: \nCorporate Theme Anal ysis\nAs spin-offs and divestitures become more common, companies have to justify why they retain \nownership of their component businesses.

Work with our clients indicates that both hard and soft elements of organizational design can greatly influence the effectiveness of value-\nbased management. The important hard areas are structure (who reports to whom), decision rights \n(who can make decisions), people (who holds key jobs), and coordination mechanisms (how do things get communicated or done). The soft areas include beliefs (how much potential people \nbelieve exists in a market ) and values (what people think is im portant ) as well as leadershi p style.\nOne essential organizational question is, \"Does our organization have clearly defined performance \nunits and individual accountabilities?\" If not, the company will have difficulty setting targets, measuring performance, and rewarding success either for a unit or for an individual. In general, we recommend that performance units be defined according to scope (coherence of products and of \ncustomers), control (profit-and-loss accountability), and materiality (big enough that top \nmana\ngement wants to s pend time on performance discussions with its mana gers).\nWithin a unit, the overall performance responsibilities for each individual or work team should also \nbe defined. Generally a flat, decentralized organization structure is recommended for making value \nhappen, as this enables transparency and clear communication. But in keeping with the belief, \n\"There is no one 'right' organization,\" if a company finds that accountability and decision rights are clear in a centralized or\nganization structure, there is no need to chan ge for chan ge's sake.\nStructure can impede or enhance performance in other ways. For example, the dominant axis along \nwhich a company is organized should reflect its sources of advantage (e.g., a company that thrives \non being close to the market might best be organized along a regional axis). However, changing an organizational structure is a major intervention into the daily life of a company. So less intrusive moves, such as changes in decision rights, putting new people in key positions, or improving \ncoordination mechanisms, ma\ny also be able to resolve or ganizational problems.\nSoft issues can be equally important blockers or enablers of performance within an organization. As \nan example, if engineers hold the belief, \"Every power plant we build must be customized,\" this may entail extra design and production expenses that cut into overall profitability, when in fact \ncustomers might be willing to accept standardized models.

To make value happen, managers need to address these \npsycholo gical and mental blocks to hi gher performance.\nIt is difficult to work directly on changing beliefs and values. One approach that we have taken is to \nsurvey managers anonymously about how much they agree with a series of statements related to a certain belief or value. The survey asks not only about the headline belief (''We need to grow\") but \nabout degree of commitment (\"I really believe this is an important goal\"), feasibility (\"I think we \ncan achieve the target on schedule\"), skills (\"I know what to do in order to create growth\"), and other logically consistent beliefs.

Properly done, the process of defining value drivers can help managers in three ways. First, it can help both business unit managers and their staff understand how value is created \nand maximized in the business. Second, it can help in prioritizing these drivers and thus in \ndetermining where resources should be placed (or removed). Third, it can align business unit mana\ngers and em ployees around a common understandin g of to p priorities.\nAs we will use the term here, a value driver is a performance variable that has impact on the results \nof a business, such as production effectiveness or customer satisfaction. The metrics associated with \nthe value drivers are called key performance indicators  (KPIs). Such metrics might be capacity \nutilization or customer retention rates. KPIs are used both for target setting and for performance measurement. Three \nprinciples are central to definin g value drivers well:\n1. Value drivers should be directly linked to shareholder value creation and cascade down \nthroughout the organization .

Second, it allows management to objectively balance and prioritize \ndifferent value drivers as well as short-term and long-term actions. When difficult decisions must be \nmade, management can use long-term value creation as the criterion for the decision\u2014and as a rationale to communicate the decision to a ske\nptical stock market.\nNote that a shareholder value focus does not exclude other important objectives for a company, such \nas safety or environmental concerns. These constraints can also be included in the value driver definition and in performance scorecards. What is important is that there are clear rules about how and when these objectives take precedence over shareholder value maximization, so that the value focus isn't diluted.\n2. Value drivers should be targeted and measured by both financial and operational KPIs . \nCompanies frequently undertake value driver analysis by breaking down return on invested capital into its component financial measures (as discussed in Chapter 9 on return-on-invested-capital \ntrees). This is a good beginning, but by itself doesn't provide a full understanding of value drivers. \nFor one thing, management has no way to affect financial ratios directly; it can only do so by affecting operating factors. So management must go one step further. For example, if a hard goods retailer wants to analyze how it can increase the earnings-before-income-taxes (EBIT) margin, it needs to break down the EBIT margin into its components\u2014gross margin, warehouse costs, \ndelivery costs, and other selling, general, and administrative costs. It can then disaggregate the \nfactors driving each kind of cost, so that delivery costs can be broken down into trips per transaction, the cost per trip, and number of transactions. This level of operating detail allows mana\ngers to anal yze concrete im provement actions.\nOperational numbers are particularly useful as leading indicators. Financial ratios alone can fail to \nalert managers that there are problems ahead. For example, a business unit's return on invested capital may improve on a short-term basis because the management team is failing to maintain assets or make needed investments.

Therefore, value driver analysis should highlight drivers to grow at a \nreturn above the cost of capital as well as drivers to improve today's return on invested capital. For a \nretailer, this might include the number of stores to be opened in a given year or the number of new \nproduct categories introduced. Sometimes, though, growth does not come in easily measured units such as new stores. For some cases, the right answer is to use project-based measures. In a metals company, the source of growth might be the introduction of a new process, for which milestones in \nimplementation might serve as the value drivers. In other cases, using qualitative measures is more \nappropriate. A consumer goods company may need to rate its own understanding of market trends as excellent, \ngood, fair, or poor.\nAs a natural outcome of these principles, note that each business unit should have its own set of key \nvalue drivers and KPIs. Although a corporate center may be tempted to impose the same template \non all business units in a company, this is often not meaningful for any measures beyond high-level financial numbers. Even when two business units are in the same industry, it may be best for them to focus on separate value drivers if their current performance is different. For example, a business \nunit with superior operating performance and margins should focus on growth-related KPIs while a \nlow mar\ngin unit should focus on cost-related KPIs.\nAlso note that a business unit should limit the number of performance indicators. Managers should \nmonitor these numbers regularly to obtain an overview of business performance, with other value \ndrivers used as supplemental diagnostic indicators to understand underlying issues. Experience \nsuggests that 5 to 10 KPIs are sufficient to provide a good overview, with 20 an upper bound. If a company tries to use more than 20, it will probably have difficulty deciding which numbers to focus on.\nThe process of value driver definition has three phases (which are described here sequentially, \nalthough in practice there is significant iteration): identification, prioritization, and institutionalization, as illustrated in Exhibit 6.4.\n1. Identification . The first task is creating value trees that systematically link the operating elements \nof the business to value creation. While mathematical links are desirable, it is better to include a nonquantifiable link than to omit it. It is also helpful to draw trees in at least three different ways (see Exhibit 6.5) to provoke creativity and thoroughness. Management can then integrate these into a single tree that best reflects its understanding of the business.

The division's new chief operating officer wanted to switch to an aggressive growth strategy to regain market share. This strategy had a price tag of $100 million for \nrefurbishing branch bank facilities, installing automatic teller machines, better training for tellers, \nand a new advertising campaign. While the bank's CEO originally rejected the new strategy because it would lead to reduced return on equity in the first year, he changed his mind when a DCF valuation showed that the value of the aggressive growth strategy was 124 percent higher than that of the harvest strate\ngy.\n\u2022 A consumer products company determined that pursuing accelerated category growth had twice \nthe potential value increase and a fraction of the downside compared with expanding the brand into new \nproducts.\nAnother benefit of making a direct link between strategy and valuation is that this explicitly links \nthe strategy development process with other efforts to make value happen. If the business unit strategy process is not set up with a value creation focus, then performance management will be less meanin\ngful, as its goals ma y not be con gruent with the chosen strate gy.\nSetting Valu e-Linked Tar gets\nTranslating strategy into specific quantitative goals requires management to set value-linked targets. \nIn this section, we will focus on the target-setting process for a business unit, but the principles can \nbe applied to more s pecific tar gets such as those used for frontline performance.\nA starting point is deciding what principles to use in setting targets.

We recommend looking at the actual \nopportunities available along each of the key performance indicators.

This is particularly important for \nbusinesses where one or more of the key drivers\u2014commodity prices, for example\u2014is influenced by factors outside of management's control.

Getting a fit between top-down and bottom-up targets requires \nnegotiation between the center and the business unit, which makes the target-setting process an \niterative one. While this demands more time and energy than simply dictating targets from the top, the iterative approach draws more deeply on the business unit managers' expertise and is more likely to \ngain their true commitment.\nA well-informed corporate center is the most important prerequisite for this dialogue. Top \nmanagement, particularly the CEO, needs a good understanding of the economics and operating environment of each business, independent of the information provided by the business itself. Various approaches can make this happen, including having the corporate center operate as a kind of principal investing firm, or having an \"equity analysis\" function within the corporate center. \nWhen these approaches work well, they can provide useful support for the business unit as well as \ninsi\nght for the CEO.\nAfter agreeing on a target, the corporate center and business unit can formalize this commitment in a \nperformance contract. The contract should contain the milestones and quantitative and qualitative \ngoals that the business unit intends to achieve throughout the performance period.

These provide a series of forums throughout the year for managers and employees to evaluate and discuss performance and look for ways to improve. Some factors for success in performance reviews are the information used in the reviews, the timing of the overall \ncalendar, and the tone of the discussions.\nThe best information base for the reviews is a scorecard incorporating value metrics and KPIs from \nthe value driver analysis. It is tempting for managers to think that financial reports alone can serve \nas the basis for performance discussions. Accounting inputs are only part of the picture. A scorecard \nalso should contain value metrics grounded in economic results and KPIs that reveal underlying performance. As a measure of value creation over a period of time, economic profit is widely used. For the drivers of value creation, historical KPIs show the operating performance behind the financial results. For example, if revenue is dropping, is the cause lower market share, more \ndiscounts than usual, or other factors? Additionally, leading indicators give a sense of future \ndevelopments and may head off any negative trends. A sample of a scorecard that contains these elements is included in Exhibit 6.6.\nWhile it can be tempting for the corporate center to impose one scorecard on all its business units, \nthis is shortsighted. Any gains in comparability across businesses are more than offset by the losses \nin understanding the unique drivers of value in each unit. The ideal model is to have custom-tailored scorecards cascading down in each business, so that each manager can monitor the key value drivers most important to him or her. Once managers know what data they want to review in the scorecards, \nthey need to establish how they will get the data in a timely, complete, and accurate way for each \nreview. Companies differ in the degree to which they decide to automate this process. Some choose elaborate software solutions, whereas others get by with more informal systems. In either case, the process should be as streamlined as possible so that reviews do not precipitate a data collection crisis each time they occur. Accuracy of the data in the scorecards is critical so that people feel they \nare being measured fairly. Further, management must figure out how it will capture qualitative data \non a continual basis.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2871, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c8ed913-b781-4441-8397-addd16d47eba": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c8ed913-b781-4441-8397-addd16d47eba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "169d1a21-a7c8-448b-9070-634db15e8997", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "61f96ef1d15e8c88bc5df8ae0f13e853a7fedae8cc97e6e1f71b280308c945d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "285ecb63-472a-4e20-a27d-23d94afe43f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "0c0d6a46e4b54bc77fdf35ddd78fef16caaa10ee00ab0aeb9cf75268f2f01468", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c20ae3e9-56a5-4dc4-948a-cb4c56c26375", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d338dc0fff4c880abceb9e01f75749dcb4b4c9d135524c520d1b4f06023581d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 105\nExhibit 6.6 Sample Performance Scorecard for a Business Unit\nScorecards are the ''what\" of performance reviews; the calendar is the \"when.\" Reviews need to happen as part of a structured, repeating cycle, as this \nmakes them an on-going part of management's agenda for the business.

Be aware in advance that there is no one recipe or master plan that \nwill make value happen at all companies. The examples below, taken from two companies that have \nsuccessfull y moved to a shareholder value focus, illustrate two different paths:\n1. An industrial products company began with a full-scale organizational redesign focusing on \nrestructuring into performance units. The corporate center then set aggressive targets for each of \nthose units. To give business unit managers direction on how to achieve these targets, the company \nembarked on detailed value driver analysis and instituted business performance management in various units.\n2. A conglomerate began at the corporate center, reviewing its aspirations and portfolio and \ndeciding on its overall framework for business performance management. The center then rolled out \nthe s\nystem to each business unit in turn.\nEach company will need to develop its own timeline tailored to specific needs. Most companies can \nbenefit by beginning with certain diagnostic analyses. On the financial dimension, we recommend \nthat companies do a valuation and economic profit calculation for each business unit to determine where value is being created or destroyed. Reverse-engineering expectations in the share price helps management understand where the market thinks that the company should be in the future. Management can then review companywide aspirations and targets in light of both ''what is\" and \n\"where we mi\nght be.\"\nOn the organizational dimension, management needs to develop a fact base on how well current \norganizational structure and performance management processes are working. Often companies do this by having staff at various levels answer questionnaires about how the current state of the \ncompany compares with the value-creating best practices described above. (Note that these need to \nbe anonymous so that people will answer freely.)

We attempt to provide a general perspective and share our thoughts \nabout some of the lessons we have learned.\nWinners and Losers\nWhether M&A activity benefits the economy is often debated by economists, politicians, journalists, \nand people in the street. The reality is that there are as many answers as there are deals and vantage \npoints from which to argue. A merger may be good for shareholders of both the acquiring and \nacquired companies but bad for the economy if it creates a monopoly position detrimental to consumers. An individual who loses his or her job or a town that loses its main plant to merger cutbacks are not immediately (and may never be) better off than they were. Conversely, real improvements in efficiency can lead to higher quality and less costly products. The economy overall \nis likely to be more vibrant, opportunity-rich, and create more jobs if resources are continuously \nmoved out of lower value uses into more \nprofitable ones.\nThat said, our main concern is creation of value for shareholders. Anyone considering an acquisition \nneeds to understand the basic fact that many corporate acquisitions fail to increase shareholder \nvalue. The market for corporate control is fairly efficient: easy, good deals are hard to come by, if they exist at all. Most successful deals result from highly disciplined deal making\u2014and sometimes \njust good luck.\nTwo broad types of research provide this warning. Academic studies typically look at the ex ante  \nmarket reaction to the announcement of a deal, taking into account not only expected costs and benefits of the deal, but also the market's expectation of whether the deal will actually be consummated. This approach assumes the market is smart and able to size up the price paid, \npotential synergies, and integration ability of the managements involved to arrive at an unbiased \nestimate of the likelihood of a deal adding to the value of a company. Another analytical approach is ex post,  assessing merger programs after their completion\u2014looking back to see how what did \nha\nppen com pares with what had been ho ped for.\nEx Ante Market Reactions\nExhibit 7.1 summarizes the results of dozens of academic studies of transactions involving public \ncompanies.

They \nstarted with companies in either the Fortune 200 largest U.S. industrials or the Financial Times  top \n150 U.K. industrials. A program was judged successful if it earned its cost of capital or better on funds invested in it, after giving the programs at least three years to season. Programs usually involved multiple acquisitions such as General Mills' 47 acquisitions of small, high-growth, \nconsumer-oriented companies.

Of the 23 percent of U.S. programs that were successful, 92 \npercent had hi gh performin g core businesses.\nIn another study, Anslinger and Copeland looked at the results achieved by 13 leveraged buyout \nfirms and 8 U.S. corporate buyers of businesses that seemed not to have synergies with the acquirer.\n2 Overall, these 21 companies were very successful. They made 829 acquisitions and 80 \npercent believed they had earned more than the cost of capital invested in their deals. The U.S. corporate acquirers averaged more than 18 percent return to shareholders over a 10-year period, \noutperforming the S&P 500 during the period. The buyout firms reported that return to investors \nexceeded 35 percent in the period. The results provide a sharp contrast to those obtained by the t\nypical lar ge cor porate bu yer described earlier.\nHow did the buyout firms do it? They focused on quickly improving operating performance at \nacquired companies. They identified and created big incentives for the top leaders at the companies\u2014and replaced them if their performance did not make the grade. They focused on the cash flow generated by the business, rather than accounting earnings, and used an active and interactive involvement among owners, board members, and management to push the pace of \nchange and create a sense of urgency. Finally, many of the acquirers had their personal wealth \ninvolved in each deal. They concentrated on buying at reasonable prices, identifying concrete operating improvements, and extracting their investment within five years. This is quite a contrast to the typical large company, where management has little direct stake in a business it buys and can be easil\ny deluded into acce pting ''strate gic\" ar guments for paying more.\nOverall, the record suggests that profitable growth by acquisition is not easy, although some \nmanagement teams and buyers have been successful. More often, management finds that its acquisition proposals are met with skepticism and worse by investors and by poor returns \nafterwards.\nReasons for Failure\nWhy are so many acquisitions failures? Setting luck aside, most acquisitions turn out badly because \npurchasers have paid too much\u2014a situation from which it is hard to recover since it happens \nu\npfront.

Four reasons we have seen are: (1) overoptimistic appraisal of market \npotential, (2) overestimation of synergies, (3) poor due diligence, and (4) overbidding. No executive \nsets out deliberately to overpay. However, once the deal process begins, events and rationalizations \nprey upon even the most disciplined acquirers. The more time and effort that has gone into a deal, the harder it is to admit that it won't create value for shareholders at a given price or on particular terms, re\ngardless of sheer business lo gic.\nOveroptimistic Appraisal o f Market Potential\nAcquisition is a dangerous enterprise if based on the assumption that a market will rebound from a \ncyclical slump or that a company will turn around. No less problematic or uncommon is the \nassumption that rapid growth will continue indefinitely. Remember, if you pay a premium to acquire \na company you will either need to capture synergies, improve the company's operations, or both. If you cannot do either, then you are betting against the market and the seller, and both are likely to know more about the business than \nyou do.\nWe can't rule out the possibility that a company's actual value is higher than its market value. But \none should be skeptical and be sure to understand where and why the market's assumptions about the future are different than yours. In fact, it is less unusual for a company's traded market value to exceed its underlying value, since at times many companies have some expectation of a takeover \nreflected in their stock prices. This points out the need for an independent assessment of the value o\nf \na com pany on a standalone basis as the essential under pinnin g of an y deal.\nOverestimation o f Synergies\nSynergy is a peculiar word\u2014depending on the context it either stands for the pipe dreams of \nmanagement or a hard-nosed rationale for a deal. Often it is a little of both. Consider the following example: A large health services company paid several billion dollars for a more profitable company in a related industry segment. Given its stepped-up investment base, the target's post \nacquisition after-tax earnings would have had to be about $500 million for the acquirer's return on \nits investment to approach its cost of capital. The year before the transaction was consummated, the target's earnings were about $225 million. Therefore, it needed to close an earnings gap of more than $275 million through \"operating synergies.\" That meant more than doubling the earnings base. The acquirer's inability to make improvements of this magnitude resulted in destruction of \nsignificant shareholder value. In the ensuing three years, market indices rose while the acquirer's \nreturns to its shareholders were actually negative.

It has an intensive legal \nand accounting aspect to it that involves large numbers of accountants and lawyers working long \nhours in unpleasant conditions. There is also a need for secrecy and speed, since leaks can prompt problems with securities regulators, customers, suppliers, and employees. Beyond this, many participants are either inexperienced or not sure what they are looking for. And many people do not want to be the bearer of bad news, especially as the process becomes more frenetic and the CEO and \nothers get more excited about doing the deal.

It goes almost without saying that poor implementation can ruin even the best strategy. In M&A situations, the execution of a sound business strategy is made especially difficult by the complex task of integrating two different organizations. Relationships \nwith customers, employers, and suppliers are often disrupted during the process; this disruption may \ncause damage to the value of the business. Aggressive acquirers often believe they can improve the target's performance by injecting better management talent, but end up chasing much of the talent out. Yet it is this very integration that should yield the returns to make the acquisition pay off. Failure to integrate can be as costly as integrating poorly.

For example, it is tempting to assume that revenues for a new combined \ncompany will be the sum of the predecessor companies' sales plus a boost from cross-selling \nadditional products. The reality can be quite different. First, the fact of a merger itself will disrupt customer relationships, leading to loss of business. Second, smart competitors use mergers as a prime opportunity to break into new accounts\u2014including recruiting star salespeople or product \nspecialists. Finally, customers are not shy about asking for price and other concessions in the midst \nof a merger, which salespeople will be eager to offer for fear of losing the business and getting bad publicity. It is hard to overestimate how much effort is required to deal with such issues, and to underestimate the im\npact if you do not.\nLikewise, on paper, salesforces might be integrated to move more product through the same number \nof salespeople. Reality in the field might be quite different if the salesforces of the merging companies do not make exactly the same customer calls. For example, it is unlikely that two college textbook companies, one specializing in liberal arts books and the other in scientific texts, can profit \nfrom salesforce savings. Salespeople in the two companies actually visit different parts of campus, \nwith little redundanc\ny.\nSometimes value can be gained from skills or technology transfer through the merger.

This way you will at least avoid mixin\ng the two and know what you're countin g on to make a deal work.\nIn parallel with understanding your business strategy and how it may be aided by acquisitions, there \nare a number of housekeeping/homework tasks that should be addressed before getting involved in a deal.\nHousekeeping/homework means identifying the details that are necessary for getting a transaction \nevaluated and approved (or not) ahead of time. Concretely, this means knowing who in the organization needs to approve a deal as a formal matter. What must go to the board of directors and when? Which types of deals must shareholders approve?

It may make sense to explain your \nacquisition criteria to selected investment banks and others that may have special insight or access into potential candidates. However, it is best not to sit back and passively react to investment \nbanking proposals for acquisition candidates. It is much better to develop and actively cultivate your \nown. Often, if a banker approaches you with a company for sale, odds are that the company is being widely shopped. In this event, you will likely end up paying top dollar to acquire it after a time-\npressured evaluation and due dili gence process\u2014hardl y a prescri ption for success.\nThe best approach is to develop a database and set of files on all prospective candidates in your \nareas of interest. It is likely that you will track many candidates for several years and will want to update your information periodically. You will want to consider publicly held companies, divisions of companies, privately held companies, and foreign as well as domestic companies. You will be \naware of many candidates as a result of business strategy work. At this point you may find it useful \nto winnow the universe of candidates by employing a list of knock-out criteria. Targets that are too large, too small, or heavily connected with unrelated businesses can be quickly eliminated. The end product of this stage should be a set of candidates that have solid businesses; offer potential for revenue and cost synergies; fit culturally so they can be integrated with least disruption; are \naffordable, and are available \n(at least possibl y) for purchase.\nStep 3\u2014 \nAssess Hi gh Potential Candidates in Depth\nOnce you have narrowed your list of candidates to a handful of realistic possibilities, you will begin \nthe detailed work of valuing each candidate and identifying your strategy for creating value. You will need a plan that more than earns back the purchase price, including a premium that you would have to pay to complete a deal. With takeover premiums running 30 percent to 40 percent and more \nabove the pre-acquisition market values, you will want to be sure the synergies are both large and \nclearl\ny identified.\nWhen undertaking a detailed evaluation of the remaining candidates, keep in mind the distinction \nbetween the value to you and the price you will need to pay. Your obvious objective should be to \nmaximize the former while minimizing the latter. The essential starting point is a clear \nunderstanding of the value of the company to you under your ownership. This consists of its standalone value, as operated by current management; likely net synergies from the combination, after taking into account potential lost business from disruption, and transactions costs, such as \nrestructurin\ng char ges and deal fees.

Likewise, synergies should be categorized and quantified wherever possible. You should also assess how long it will take to capture the synergies. And don't forget about the impact of competitor reactions to your deal that \ncould have a financial im\npact on the combined firm.\nWhen valuing synergies, you will need to identify not only the synergies that you can obtain, but \nalso those that may accrue to other potential acquirers. If the synergies that you can capture are less than those that can be captured by a competitor, you are likely to lose in a bidding war. Synergies \nfall into one of three broad cate\ngories, as detailed b y Bill Pursche:3\n1. Universal . Generally available to any logical acquirer with capable management and adequate \nresources. Examples are economies of scale (such as leveraging the fixed cost of a management \ninformation systems department or eliminating redundant senior management) and some exploitable \nopportunities (raisin g prices, cuttin g corporate overhead, and eliminatin g waste ).\n2. Endemic . Available to only a few acquirers, typically those in the same industry as the seller. \nThese include economies of scope (broadened geographic coverage) and most exploitable \nopportunities (redundant sales forces ).\n3. Unique. Opportunities that can be ex ploited onl y by a specific bu yer (or seller ).\nThe value to the buyer and seller depends on the type of synergy and who controls it. Universal \nsynergies, since they are widely accessible, usually accrue to the sellers as do unique synergies, if \nunder control of the seller. If the buyer possesses the unique synergy, it may pay a lower price (because there is no competing buyer) and keep most of the value. This is especially the case where the buyer has alternate means of ''monetizing\" the capability that does not depend on acquiring a \ns\npecific tar get com pany.\nEndemic synergies fall in between, with the buyer and seller potentially sharing the value created as \na result of who brin gs what to the table and the parties' res pective ne gotiatin g skills and power.\nWhen analyzing synergies, consider restructuring and financial engineering. Assets that are worth \nmore to other owners can be profitably redeployed through liquidations, divestitures, spin-offs, or levera\nged bu youts.

This courtship process can be delicate, and may require years until actual combination discussions take \nplace. Many sellers do not want to sell\u2014they have their own plans they believe in and prefer to \nremain independent. If the target company's financial situation allows it, then there is little that can be done until circumstances change. If the company is publicly traded and has weak defenses, you may want to consider a hostile bid, but this will make the job of finalizing your assessment of the tar\nget ver y difficult and set a poor tone for effective inte gration after the deal.\nThe purpose of a discreet courtship process is threefold: to learn more about whether there is a good \nfit between the companies, to convince the sellers to sell, and, to convince them to sell to you, \npreferably through exclusive negotiations where you can achieve better price and terms than in a \ncompetitive situation.\nOnce the sellers are at the table, the negotiations begin in earnest. Negotiating carefully and \npurposefully will help you avoid overpaying and boxing yourself into terms that will make successful post-merger management difficult.

They are usually well known to competitors and recruiters and vulnerable to being lured away. Do not underestimate the depth of anxiety even star producers may feel in the midst of a merger.

Alliances are more \neffective for ed ging into related businesses or new geographic areas.\n\u2022 Alliances between stron g and weak rarel y work.\n\u2022 Successful alliances must be able to evolve beyond their initial objectives. This requires autonomy \nand flexibilit y.\n\u2022 More than 75 percent of the alliances that are terminated end with an acquisition by one of the \nparents.\nTo be considered a success in the study, an alliance had to pass two tests. First, both partners had to \nachieve their on-going strategic objectives. Second, they both had to recover their financial cost of \ncapital. For acquisitions exceeding 20 percent of the acquirer's market value, the deal was judged to \nbe a financial success if the acquirer was able to maintain or improve its return on equity and return on assets. For smaller acquisition programs, interviews were conducted to assess financial success. A comparison of cross-border mergers and acquisitions with cross-border alliances shows the same success rate\u2014about 50 \npercent.\nThe motivation for cross-border mergers and acquisitions, however, seems to be different than for \njoint ventures. Mergers and acquisitions seem to benefit from geographical overlap, perhaps because \nsynergies such as consolidation of production facilities, integration of distribution networks, and \nreorganization of sales forces are more easily achieved by high geographical proximity. Alliances, \non the other hand, are usually intended to expand the geographical reach of the partners. There are fewer alliances with high geographical overlap and they have a much lower success rate for both \npartners.\nOwnership structure is also important for the success of joint ventures. When the ownership of the \njoint venture was evenly split, the probability of success for both was 60 percent compared with \nonly 31 percent when the ownership split was uneven. Alliances work best when both parents are strong. When one partner or the other is weak, the ''weak link\" becomes a drag on the venture's \ncompetitiveness and hinders successful management. When one parent has a majority stake, it tends \nto dominate decision-making and puts its own interests above those of the partner, or the joint venture itself.\n5 J. Bleeke and D.

Flexibility is important because \nthe relative power of the parents will inevitably change, because markets and customer needs will \nshift, and new technologies arise. During interviews with the top companies that have alliances, \nBleeke and Ernst found that of those alliances that evolved, 79 percent were successful and 89 percent were still surviving at the end of the sample period. Of those alliances whose scope had remained unchan\nged, onl y 33 percent were successful and more than half had ended.\nFlexibility and autonomy can be built by giving the joint venture a strong, independent president \nand a full business system of its own (R&D, sales, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution) and \nprovidin g it with an inde pendent, powerful board of directors.\nJoint ventures have a limited life span. More than 75 percent of the terminated partnerships were \nacquired by one of the partners. This does not necessarily imply that the joint venture failed. Alliances often end after meeting the partner's goals. It does mean that it is useful to prepare for the break-up of the alliance. If the eventual seller does not anticipate such an outcome the sale can \ncompromise its long-term strategic interests. Often the natural buyer is the company that is the most \nwillin\ng to invest to build the joint venture.\nSummary\nAn active market for corporate control drastically reduces the chances of success for acquiring \ncompanies. Even in situations where the acquired company is in the same line of business as the \nacquirer and is small enough to allow easy post-merger integration, the likelihood of success is only about 50 \npercent.\nA disciplined acquisition program is essential. You must have control of the process. Don't rely on \nthe deals brought to you by third parties. Find your own targets, starting with a self-analysis that \nleads to a value-addin g approach.\nIdentify useful knockout criteria in the screening process. Before bidding on a candidate, understand \nexactly how you intend to recoup a takeover premium. Try to find synergies that are unique\u2014those \nthat cannot be captured by another bidder. Decide on your maximum price and stick to it as part of a carefully planned negotiation strategy. Finally, move as quickly as possible during post-merger inte\ngration and carefull y mana ge the process.\nJoint ventures are a form of alliance that permit temporary relationships that focus more specifically \non parts of the business system.

In particular, we made the case \nthat a company's value is driven by its ability to generate cash flow over the long term. Furthermore, a company's cash-flow generating ability (and hence its value creation ability) is driven by long-term \ngrowth and the returns that the com pany earns on invested ca pital relative to its cost of ca pital.\nPart Two provides a step-by-step guide to analyzing and valuing a company, including technical \ndetails on how to get the numbers right and guidelines for interpreting the results. The first chapter of Part Two provides a high-level summary of how to value a company using the discounted cash flow approach and describes some of the alternatives to this method. Chapters 9 to 13 detail each \nste\np in the valuation process.\nWhile there are a number of ways to apply the discounted cash flow (DCF) approach, over the next \nfive chapters we will describe two in detail: the enterprise DCF model and the economic profit model. The enterprise DCF model is the most widely used in practice. The economic profit model is \ngaining in popularity. Its advantage is that it highlights whether a company is earning its cost of \ncapital. It is important to point out that both models result in exactly the same value, so the choice is mostly driven by the instincts of the user. At the end of this chapter, we discuss two other models: the adjusted present value (APV) model and the equity DCF model. These models are particularly \nuseful in special situations. For example, the equity DCF model is best suited for financial \ninstitutions such as banks and insurance com\npanies.

This would not be satisfying, however, because you have not evaluated the free cash flow projection upon which the valuation was based. How does the \nprojection compare to past performance? How does the projection compare with other companies? \nWhat are the economics of the business? Are they expressed in a way that managers and others can understand? What are the important factors that could increase or decrease the value of the company? You need to step back and understand the underlying economic value drivers of the \nbusiness.\nSince value is based on discounted free cash flow, the underlying value drivers of the business must \nalso be the drivers of free cash flow. As we explained in Chapters 3 and 4, there are two key drivers of free cash flow and ultimately value: the rate at which the company is growing its revenues, \nprofits, and capital base, and the return on invested capital (relative to the cost of capital). These \nvalue drivers make common sense. A company that earns higher profit for every dollar invested in the business will be worth more than a similar company that earns less profit for every dollar of invested capital. Similarly, a faster growing company will be worth more than a slower growing company if they are both earning the same return on invested capital (and this return is high enough \nto satisf\ny the investors ).\nA simple model will demonstrate how growth and return on invested capital actually drive free cash \nflow. First, some definitions are needed.

In this model, the value of a company equals the amount of capital invested, plus a premium \nequal to the present value of the value created each year. The concept of economic profit dates to at least 1890, when the economist Alfred Marshall wrote: ''What remains of his [the owner or manager's] profits after deducting interest on his capital at the current rate may be called his earnin\ngs of undertakin g or mana gement.\"1\nMarshall said that the value created by a company during any time period (its economic profit) must take into account not only the expenses recorded in its accounting records but also the opportunity cost of the ca\npital em ployed in the business.\nAn advantage of the economic profit model over the DCF model is that economic profit is a useful \nmeasure for understanding a company's performance in any single year, while free cash flow is not. For example, you would not track a company's progress by comparing actual and projected free cash flow because free cash flow in any year is determined by discretionary investments in fixed assets \nand working capital.

Another way to define economic profit is as after-tax operating profits less \na char ge for the ca pital used b y the com pany.\nThis alternative calculation generates the same value for economic profit:\nThis approach shows that economic profit is similar in concept to accounting net income, but it ex\nplicitly char ges a com pany for all its ca pital, not just the interest on its debt.\nA simple example will illustrate how economic profit can be used for valuations. Assume that \nCompany C from above invested $1,000 in working capital and fixed assets at the beginning of \nperiod 1. Each year after that it earns $100 of NOPLAT (a 10 percent ROIC). Its net investment is zero, so its free cash flow is also $100. Company C's economic profit is $20 a year as calculated above.\nThe economic profit approach says that the value of a company equals the amount of capital \ninvested \nplus a premium or discount e qual to the present value of its projected economic profit:\nThe logic behind this is straightforward. If a company earned exactly its WACC every period, then \nthe discounted value of its projected free cash flow should exactly equal its invested capital. The \ncompany is worth exactly what was originally invested. A company is worth more or less than its invested capital only to the extent that it earns more or less than its WACC. Therefore, the premium or discount relative to invested capital must equal the present value of the company's future economic \nprofit.\nCompany C earns $20 a year more than investors demand (its economic profit). So the value of \ncompany C should equal $1,000 (its invested capital at the time of the valuation) plus the present value of its economic profit.

Professor Clifford Smith of the \nUniversity of Rochester illustrates this with the story of the former American baseball player Yogi \nBerra at a pizza parlor. Berra is asked whether he would like his pizza cut into six or eight pieces. \nBerra replies: ''Six please, I am not hungry enough to eat eight.\" Of course, the pizza is the same size no matter how man\ny pieces you cut it into.\nThe implication of MM for valuation in a world without taxes is that the weighted average cost of \ncapital must be constant regardless of the company's capital structure. This must be so if the total value is constant and the free cash flows are by definition independent of the capital structure. The result is that capital structure can only affect value through taxes and other market imperfections and distortions.\nThe APV model uses these concepts to highlight the impact of taxes on valuation. The APV model \nfirst values a company at the cost of capital if the company had no debt in its capital structure (referred to as the unlevered cost of equity). It then adds the impact of taxes from leverage to this \nvalue. In most countries, interest payments made by a company are deductible for tax purposes. \nTherefore, the overall taxes paid by a company and its investors are lower if the company employs debt in its ca\npital structure.\nIn the enterprise DCF model, this tax benefit is taken into consideration in the calculation of the \nweighted average cost of capital by adjusting the cost of debt by its tax benefit. In the APV model, \nthe tax benefit from the company's interest payments is estimated by discounting the projected tax savings. If done correctly and with identical assumptions about capital structure, both models will result in the same value.\nKey to reconciling the two approaches is the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital. The \nfollowing equation is one approach to relating WACC to the unlevered cost of equity assuming that the tax benefit of debt is discounted at the unlevered cost of equity. (See Appendix A for alternative a\npproaches. )\nWhere ku = Unlevered cost of e quity\nkb = Cost of debt\nT = Marginal tax rate on interest expense\nB   = Market value of debt\nS   = Market value of equity\nLet's illustrate the APV model with the Hershey case.

While we present this process sequentially, \nvaluation is typically more of an iterative process. As you learn more, you develop new questions \nand insi ghts that re quire revisitin g earlier work.\nThe first step in valuing a business is analyzing its historical performance. A sound understanding o f \nthe company's past performance provides an essential perspective for developing and evaluating \nforecasts of future performance. (This assumes that the company has a history, which is not always \nthe case. See the discussion on valuing Internet stocks in Chapter 15, when you don't have historical information.\n)\nHistorical performance analysis should focus on the key value drivers discussed in Chapter 8: namely, return on invested capital and growth. The rate of return on invested capital (ROIC) is the single most important value driver. A company creates value for its shareholders only when it earns rates of return on new invested capital that exceed its cost of capital. Return on invested capital and the proportion of its profits that the company invests for growth drive free cash flow, which in turn \ndrives value.\nHistorical analysis, done well, is an integrated process. ROIC and growth are broken down into their \ncomponent drivers (for example, ROIC is driven by capital turnover and operating profit margins). \nFinancial ratios that do not contribute to understanding ROIC and growth or that largely duplicate \nother ratios need not be used. For example, the return on total assets (ROA) is not used because ever\nything that can be learned from ROA is incor porated into the ROIC anal ysis.\nIn addition to analyzing the value drivers, you should analyze the company from a credit or liquidity \nperspective.

For example, the company may build up cash \nwhile deciding how to invest or distribute it. These excess cash or marketable securities balances are \nnot generally directly related to the company's operations, so we treat them as non-operating or as \nfinancin g (negative debt ).\nConsidering excess cash as non-operating makes valuation easier. Excess cash is usually much less \nrisky than the operations of the company. As excess cash grows or declines in relation to the size of \nthe company, its overall level of risk and cost of capital should rise or fall. Modeling the change in the cost of capital is complex. It is much easier to consider the value of a company as the sum of the value of its operating free cash flow plus the present value of the cash flow related to its excess cash, where the risk of each com\nponent is relativel y stable.\nExcess cash and marketable securities are the short-term cash and investments that the company \nholds above its target  cash balances to support operations. The target balances can be estimated by \nobserving the variability in the company's cash and marketable securities balances and comparing \nthese with similar companies. As a rule of thumb, we often consider any cash and marketable \nsecurities balances over 0.5 percent to 2.0 percent of revenues to be excess, depending on the industry. By excluding excess cash, we also can get a better sense of how operating working capital has chan\nged relative to revenues and how the com pany com pares to com petitors.\nRecognize that the investment of excess cash in short-term marketable securities is a zero-net-\npresent-value investment. (It could also be argued that they are slightly negative NPV investments if the double taxation of corporate income is considered.) The return on this investment just compensates for its risk. Therefore, the present value of the cash flow related to these marketable securities must equal the market value of the excess marketable securities on the company's books at \nthe time of the valuation. Excluding excess cash is important because we have seen companies with \ncash balances as much as $5 billion to $10 billion that are clearly not needed to run the business. Excludin\ng excess cash and securities gives us a cleaner view of the o perations of the business.\nNon-Interest-Bearin g Current Liabilities\nNon-interest-bearing current liabilities such as accounts payable and accrued expenses are \nsubtracted to calculate net operating working capital. The reason for subtracting these liabilities is to achieve consistency with the definition of NOPLAT.

The NOPLAT calculation \nbegins with EBITA, the pretax operating income that a company would have earned if it had no debt \nand no goodwill amortization. It includes all types of operating income, including most revenues \nand expenses. Generally excluded are interest income, interest expense, the gain or loss from \ndiscontinued items, extraordinary income or loss, and the investment income from non-operating investments. Depreciation of fixed assets should be subtracted in calculating EBITA but goodwill amortization should not.

Taxes on EBITA equal the total income tax provision (current and deferred) adjusted for the income taxes attributed to interest expense, interest income, and non-operating \nitems.

The \nmarginal tax rate is generally the statutory marginal rate, including state and local taxes. In \nHershey's case, we estimated its marginal tax rate to be 39 percent. For example, the tax shield on interest expense ($33) equals interest expense ($86) times the 39 percent marginal tax rate.

It measures the dollars of economic value created b\ny a com pany in a sin gle year and is defined as follows:\nRecall from Cha pter 8 that economic profit can also be defined as follows:\nwhere the ca pital char ge equals invested ca pital times WACC:\nAs a practical matter, we generally use invested capital measured at the beginning of the period or the average of beginning and ending capital. Technically, for the economic profit valuation to exactly equal the DCF valuation, you must use beginning capital. If you use average capital the \nvariance will \ngenerall y be small. Exhibit 9.6 shows the economic profit for Hershe y.\nEconomic profit is an important measure because it combines size and ROIC into a single result. \nToo often companies focus on either size (often measured by earnings) or ROIC. Focusing on size (say earnings or earnings growth) could destroy value if returns on capital are too low. Conversely, \nearnin\ng a high ROIC on a low ca pital base ma y mean missed o pportunities.\nIt is important not to confuse economic profit, which measures realized value creation, with the \nincrease in the value of a company during the period. In 1998, Hershey earned economic profit of \n$293 million. However, during 1998, the market value of Hershey's shares increased by $49 million. \nAdding the dividends paid to Hershey's shareholders of $129 million in 1998, gives a total shareholder value creation of $178 million, substantially less than economic profit. The two concepts measure different aspects of value.

Just as excess cash and marketable \nsecurities and related interest income were excluded from invested capital and NOPLAT, they \nshould be excluded from free cash flow. The change in excess marketable securities can be treated as non-operating cash flow or as financing cash flows (they can be considered negative debt).

The change in the cumulative foreign currency translation \ngains or losses account is driven by the changes in translation rates applied to both assets and debt. As a practical matter, you generally cannot separate the asset and debt gains or losses without \ninternal information. Therefore, treat these gains/losses as non-operating cash flow in the free cash \nflow. If you have the information needed to separate the asset from the debt effects, treat the gains/losses on assets as adjustments to free cash flow and gains/losses on debt as financial cash flow. (See Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52 for a discussion of foreign currenc\ny accountin g.)\nThe sum of free cash flow and the non-operating items enumerated above equals the total funds available to investors (or if negative, the funds the investors must provide). These total funds available must equal the financing cash flows.

Conversely, if free cash flow is negative, it must equal the net funds \nprovided by the company's shareholders and creditors (for example, through new issues of debt or e\nquity).\nThis equality between operating and financial flows helps ensure that the free cash calculation is \ncorrect.

While debt has tax advantages \nthat will be outlined in Chapter 10, it also can reduce a company's flexibility because debtholders expect to be paid on a set schedule, whereas the company has great flexibility in paying dividends to shareholders.

This can either be expressed on a net basis (Net investment/NOPLAT) or gross basis (Gross investment/Gross cash flow).

We can better understand the company's financial situation by analyzing the payout \nratio in relation to the investment rate. If the company has a high dividend payout ratio and an \ninvestment rate greater than one, then it must be borrowing money to fund a negative free cash flow, to pay interest, and to pay dividends.

Depending on the company, you \nmay come across one or more difficult accounting issues that will affect the estimation of NOPLAT, \ninvested capital, economic profit, and free cash flow. This section discusses the most important of these issues.\nGoodwill\nWe explicitly excluded goodwill, both the asset and the amortization, from the calculation of ROIC. \nIn most cases, ROIC should be calculated both with and without goodwill. ROIC excluding goodwill measures the operating performance of the company and is useful for comparing operating performance across companies and for analyzing trends. It is not distorted by the price premiums \npaid for acquisitions made in building the company. ROIC including goodwill measures how well \nthe company has used investors' funds. Has the company earned its cost of capital, taking into consideration the \npremiums it paid for ac quisitions?\nIt is not uncommon for companies to earn high returns on an operating basis while not earning their \ncost of capital when acquisition premiums are considered. Walt Disney acquired Cap Cities/ABC, the publishing company and television network, in 1996. As a result, it had $18 billion of cumulative goodwill at the end of 1998 compared with operating invested capital of $16 billion.

In effect, this reverses the amortization of goodwill. The reason for not amortizing \ngoodwill for economic analysis is that goodwill, unlike other fixed assets, does not wear out and is \nnot replaced. For other assets, depreciation or amortization is a proxy for the physical deterioration \nof the asset with the recognition that the asset must be replaced if the company wishes to remain in \nbusiness.\nOperatin g Leases\nOperating leases are any lease obligations that the company has not capitalized. Operating leases \nrepresent a type of financing and, if material, should be treated as such in the calculation of the com\npany's value drivers.\nTo do this, adjust the company's financial statements to treat operating leases as if they were \ncapitalized. First, reclassify the implied interest expense portion of the lease payments from an operating expense (usually in cost of goods sold, or selling, general, and administrative expense) to \nan interest expense. This increases EBITA by the amount of implied interest. Do not forget to adjust \nEBITA taxes as well. Second, add the implied principal amount of operating leases to invested capital and to debt. Finally, treat the principal amount as additional debt in the weighted average cost of capital calculation. This mimics the effects that would have occurred had the leases been ca\npitalized.\nTo estimate the implied principal amount of the operating leases, a rule of thumb is to capitalize this \nyear's or next year's lease payments as a perpetuity using the cost of debt. Another approach is to discount the future minimum lease payments (disclosed in the footnotes to U.S. audited statements) at the company's marginal borrowing rate, although this approach will understate the value of leases \nthat management intends to renew. To estimate the implied interest expense, multiply the implied \nprincipal amount b y the mar ginal borrowin g rate.\nIf you capitalize operating leases you also need to ensure that the cost of capital incorporates the \nimpact of the leases as well and you need to subtract the value of the leases from the enterprise \nvalue to derive the value of e quity.\nPensions\nAdjusting for pension plans depends on whether the plan is over- or underfunded and whether any \nover- or underfunding is recorded on the financial statements.

Let's ex plore each in turn.\nThe replacement cost approach values the plants at the cost to replace them today. We disagree with \nthe replacement cost approach for the simple reason that assets do not have to be and may never be replaced. It may be economically justifiable to continue to use an old asset even though the cost of \nreplacing it with new equipment may outweigh the higher profits that the new asset will eventually \ngenerate. Furthermore, a company with a plant built several years before its competitors (assuming the same productivity potential) at a lower cost than its competitors' plants has a real competitive advantage that should be reflected in a higher ROIC. This advantage is similar to a company that has lower labor costs because its workers are nonunionized or a company located in a low tax \njurisdiction. These advanta ges must be reflected in a com pany's returns.\nUsing the market values of assets is appropriate when the realizable market value of the assets \nsubstantially exceeds the historical cost book value. You are only likely to find tangible assets with \nsuch high values in the case of assets that have general uses beyond the company's current use of the \nassets. Real estate and airplanes are good examples where the realizable market values of the assets might exceed the book values. For most assets, such as equipment, computers, and fixtures, the market values for used assets are generally very low. For most companies, the proportion of assets with market values significantly higher than book values is low, so calculating ROIC based on book \nvalues does not introduce si\ngnificant distortions.\nIf market values are used, NOPLAT must be adjusted to reflect the annual appreciation of the value \nof the assets. It would be inconsistent to write up the assets without reflecting the appreciation in profits. This is a common error that we see when analysts argue for using market values. They \ni\ngnore the economic profit associated with the write-u p.\nIt could be argued that the reason for writing up the assets and for not including the appreciation in \nprofits is to get a sense of whether a company's assets would be better used some other way. \nConsider a retailer that owns valuable real estate. The retailer might earn less than its cost of capital \nif the market value of the real estate were used instead of its book value. While this is true, remember we are trying to analyze the company's actual performance, not whether it is making the best use of its assets. Companies should do both, measure actual performance and determine whether or not the\ny are makin g the best use of their assets.\nFinally, adjusting assets for inflation is complex. For every year, you must decompose the fixed \nassets into layers based on when they were purchased. Then each layer is revalued using an a\nppropriate price index.

This fragmentation is due in large part t o regional oligopolies. Two or three players \nwith a combined market share of 80 percent or more dominate most countries, though usually not the same players in each country  (Exhibit 9.22). In addition, Heineken is \none of only six brewers worldwide that in 1997 had at least 50 percent of sales originate outside the home country (Exhibit 9.2 3). Anheuser-Busch, on the other hand, is a \nmore typical regional brewer with more than 85 percent of its sales coming from the United States.\nEven as the major brewers have expanded outside their home markets, competition has remained local. This is largely due to cons umer preference for local brands and \ntastes, high government tariffs, regulations, and limited opportunities for economies of scale or scope across national borders . As a result, when brewers have gone into new \nmarkets, they typically focus on transferring skills such as marketing rather than building globally integrated businesses. The  dominance of local competition has slowed the \npace of industry consolidation, as local brewers don't necessarily feel the need to sell their businesses to the majors to remai n competitive.\nAs tastes converge, technology improves, transportation costs decline, and brewers learn to better leverage their expertise and  brand names, the industry will slowly begin to \nreach consumers on a global scale.

Guinness, for example, has focused on a product with a unique flavor that it exports from its home base with aggressive global marketing. \nBoston Beer Company runs a ''virtual\" beer company in which it controls product development and marketing but contracts out mos t production. Geographic integrators \nsuch as Heineken and Interbrew, on the other hand, purchase underperforming breweries or breweries in developing countries and apply best practices in brewing, \ndistribution, and marketing.\nHeineken's Financial Performance\nTo evaluate Heineken's financial performance, we compared its performance to that of other large, publicly traded beer companie s using both stock market-based measures \nand underlying financial indicators. We compared Heineken to companies that produce mostly beer, as opposed to broader consumer  goods companies where beer is just one \nof a host of products: Anheuser-Busch, Carlsberg, and South African Breweries.

Estimating the costs for many sources of capital is not very precise and the specific instruments used by the company will change. In practice, we often make simplifying assumptions. For example, we \nrarely distinguish between callable and noncallable debt in a company's capital structure because the \ncost differences are small and it is im\npossible to sa y what the mix of these instruments will be.\nNon-interest-bearing liabilities, such as accounts payable, are excluded from the calculation of \nWACC to avoid inconsistencies and simplify the valuation. Non-interest-bearing liabilities have a \ncost of capital, just like other forms of debt, but this cost is implicit in the price paid for the goods \ngenerating the liability and shows up in the company's operating costs and free cash flow.

All these factors \nmean that future financin g levels could be different from current or past levels.\nThe second reason for using a target capital structure is that it solves the problem of circularity \ninvolved in estimating the WACC. This circularity arises because we need to know market value \nweights to determine the WACC, but we cannot know the market value weights without knowing what the market value is in the first place\u2014especially the market value of equity. To determine the value of equity, which is the objective of the valuation process itself, we must discount the expected free cash flow at the WACC. In essence, we cannot know the WACC without knowing the market \nvalue of e\nquity, and we cannot know the market value of e quity without knowin g the WACC.\nOne way out of this circularity problem is to simply iterate between the weights used in the WACC \nand the resulting value of equity.

Their value depends on three \nfactors: the agreed-upon payment schedule, the likelihood the borrower will make the payments as \npromised, and the market interest rates for securities with a similar pattern of ex pected payments.\nGenerall y, their market value can be a pproximated without difficult y. The process is as follows:\n1. Identify the contractually promised payments. Is the financing instrument a variable-rate note \nwith interest determined each six months at a fixed spread over the prime rate, or a 20-year zero-cou\npon bond?\n2. Determine the credit quality of the instrument to be valued. Credit ratings are often available for \neven illiquid issues, or can be estimated from ratings on other company borrowings (adjusting for the security of the specific instrument in bankruptcy) or from bond rating models that attempt to mimic the behavior of the rating agencies.\n5 Estimate the yield to maturity for which the instrument \nwould trade were it publicly traded, by reference to market yields on securities with equivalent \ncoupons, maturities, and ratin gs.\n3.

Many companies enter into interest-rate and currency swap agreements that change the \nduration and/or currency profile of their financing. Swaps are off-balance-sheet transactions that are \ndisclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. They are also sometimes used by corporations \nto speculate on interest rates. A company could have a debt swap outstanding even though it is financed entirel\ny with common e quity.\nFor valuation purposes, swaps should be treated in the same way as any other financing instruments, \nwith the promised cash flow in the agreement valued at the prevailing market rate. This can be a complicated and nearly impossible to do without specific information about the swap instruments themselves.\nIf you can associate a swap with a specific outstanding instrument, you should estimate the value of \nthe ''synthetic\" security that the combination of the security plus swap creates. A company may have issued floating-rate debt and entered into an interest-rate swap that converts it to a five-year fixed-rate instrument. In this case, estimate the value of the five-year instrument using the standard \nprocedure noted earlier.\n\u2022 Foreign currency obligations . If a company has financing outstanding in a currency other than its \nhome currency, the value of this financing will need to be stated in terms of the company's home currency. This involves a two-step process. First, value the debt in foreign currency terms according \nto the standard procedure. Second, translate the resulting foreign currency market value into the \nhome currency by using the spot foreign exchange rate. If a U.S. company has issued 10-year Swiss franc bonds, it would determine the market value of the bonds in Swiss francs, using Swiss interest rates for e\nquivalent issues (if necessar y), and then translate the result into current U.S. dollars.\n\u2022 Leases . Leases substitute for other forms of debt and can therefore be treated like debt. Standard \naccounting principles divide leases into two classes: capital leases and operating leases. Capital leases, as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, are essentially those that transfer most of the ownershi\np risk of the asset to the lessee. All other leases are considered o peratin g leases.\nCapital leases are accounted for as if the lessee had purchased the asset and borrowed the funds. The \npresent value of the lease payments is added to the company's assets with other fixed assets and to the liability side of the balance sheet alongside other debt.

Operating leases may also be treated like other forms of debt. The market value of an operating lease is the present value of the required future lease payments \n(excluding the portion of the lease payment for maintenance) discounted at a rate that reflects the \nriskiness to the lessee of the particular lease.

These financing forms include warrants, employee stock options, convertible debt, and convertible preferred stock. When these securities are traded, their market value should be determined from their current market prices. When they are not traded, estimating their market value is more difficult than is the case with the fixed-income \nobli\ngations.\n\u2022 Warrants and employee stock options . Usually warrants represent the right to buy a set number of \nshares of the company's equity at a predetermined price. They can also be warrants to purchase other types of securities, such as preferred stock or additional debt. Warrants are essentially long-\nterm options having an original issue exercise period of five to ten years, with a strike price equal to \nthe price the holder would pay, on exercise, to acquire the underlying security. Since they are options, warrants should be valued using option-\npricing approaches. If the company you are valuing \nhas a large number of warrants or employee stock options outstanding, their cost should be included \nin the com pany's WACC.\n\u2022 Convertible securities . Convertible securities represent a combination of straight, nonconvertible \nfinancing and a specified number of warrants that comprise the conversion feature. Their value and true opportunity cost cannot be determined properly without recognizing the value of the conversion \nfeature (warrant).

The deeper in the money it is, the lower the traded yield, and vice versa.

To deal with convertible securities in a company's capital \nstructure, follow an a pproach similar to the one used for warrants.\nMinority Interests\nMinority interests represent claims by outside shareholders on a portion of a company's business. \nMinority interests usually arise after an acquisition when the acquiring company does not purchase all of the target company's shares outstanding. They can also arise if the company sells a minority stake in one of its subsidiaries to a third \nparty.\nThe treatment of minority interests depends on the information available. If the minority shares are \npublicly traded, then their approximate value can be determined directly from the market prices for the shares. If, as is more often the case, the shares are not traded, then theoretically we should value \nthe subsidiary separately using the discounted free cash flow valuation approach and compute the \nvalue of the minority stake according to the percentage of the subsidiary's shares the minority shareholders own.\nIf information about the subsidiary's free cash flow cannot be developed, then the value of the \nminority stake could be approximated by applying price-to-earnings or market-to-book ratios for \nsimilar companies to the minority's share of income or net assets. Both of these items are disclosed in the financial statements\u2014sometimes separately for each subsidiary in which a minority interest exists.\nPreferred Stoc\nk\nHolders of preferred stock receive preferred dividends perpetually. In bankruptcy, payments to \npreferred shareholders are subordinate to those of bondholders, but senior to payments to equity \nholders.

For the \ncompany's capital structure to be different is perfectly acceptable, but you should understand the reasons why it is or is not. For instance, is the company by philosophy more aggressive or innovative in the use of nonequity financing, or is the current capital structure only a temporary \ndeviation from a more conservative target? Often, companies finance acquisitions with debt that \nthey plan to pay down rapidly or refinance with a stock offering in the next year.

We recommend using a 10-year Treasury-bond rate for several \nreasons:7\n\u2022 It is a long-term rate that usually comes close to matching the duration of the cash flow of the company being valued. Since the current Treasury-bill rate is a short-term rate, it does not match duration properly. If we were to use short-term rates, the appropriate choice would be the short-term \nrates that are expected to apply in each future period, not today's short-term interest rate. The 10-\nyear rate is a geometric wei ghted avera ge estimate of the ex pected short-term Treasur y-bill rates.\n\u2022 The 10-year rate approximates the duration of the stock market index portfolio\u2014for example, the \nS&P 500\u2014and its use is therefore consistent with the betas and market risk premiums estimated \nrelative to these market portfolios.8\n\u2022 The 10-year rate is less susceptible to two problems involved in using a longer-term rate, such as \nthe 30-year Treasury-bond rate. Its price is less sensitive to unexpected changes in inflation, and so \nhas a smaller beta than the 30-year rate. Also, the liquidity premium built into 10-year rates may be \nslightly lower than that of 30-year bonds. These are technical details, with a minor impact in normal circumstances. But the\ny do ar gue for usin g a 10- year bond rate.9\nDeterminin g the Market Risk Premium\nThe market risk premium (the price of risk) is the difference between the expected rate of return on \nthe market portfolio and the risk-free rate, E(rm) \u2013 rf. The market risk premium is one of the most \nvexing issues in finance. It can be based on either historical data, assuming that the future will be \nlike the past, or on ex ante estimates that attempt to forecast the future. Both approaches have their \nproponents and critics.\nIn early 2000, we were recommending using a 4 1/2 percent to 5 percent historically estimated \nmarket risk premium for U.S. companies. Depending on the period chosen and the type of average, \nhistorically based estimates of the market risk premium can vary from about 3 percent to almost 8 \npercent,\n7 Theoretically, you should use a distinct WACC for each year's projected cash flows based on the yield curve \nfor risk-free securities.

Of the group of 24 markets that existed in 1931, only seven experienced no interruption in trading (the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland), seven suspended trading for less than a year, and the remaining 10 \nsuffered long-term closure.

Basu (1983) found a seasonal (January) effect. Bhandari (1988) demonstrated that the degree of financial leverage was important. And Stattman (1980) as \nwell as Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein (1985) found that average returns are positively related to the \nfirm's e\nquity book-to-market ratio.16\nIf beta is not dead, then surely it's wounded. Fama and French concluded that equity returns are inversely related to the size of a company measured by the value of its equity capitalization, and \npositivel y related to the ratio of the book value of the com pany's equity to its market value.\n15 E.

This might give better results than using estimates of beta and the CAPM. Another possible \nimplication, and one that Fama and French hint at, is the need to use a multifactor approach like the \narbitra\nge pricing model, which is discussed in the next section.\nThere have been some papers that add to the debate and give practitioners some reasons to stick \nwith the CAPM. In particular, the work of Kothari, Shanken, and Sloan (1995) is worth reading.17 \nThey have five ma jor conclusions. First, and most im portant:\nOur examination of the cross-section of expected returns reveals economically and statistically significant \ncompensation (about 6 to 9 percent per annum) for beta risk . . .\nSecond, they point out that the Fama and French statistical tests were of sufficiently low power that \nthey could not reject a non-trivial (beta-related) risk premium of 6 percent over the post-1940 period. Third, if annual returns are used to estimate beta (to avoid seasonality in returns) there is a statistically significant linear relationship between beta and returns over the 1941 to 1990 period. \nFourth, size is also significantly related to returns; however, the incremental economic contribution \nis not large (less than 1 percent). Finally, the relationship between return and the book/market ratio is the result of survivorshi\np bias in the Com pustat database, and is not economicall y significant.\nTo explain this last, important conclusion, let's go back to the history of the Compustat database. In \n1978 it was expanded from 2,700 to 6,000 companies by adding small companies that had survived \nuntil 1978. By definition their rates of return were higher than their failed peers and that were not included in the database. Consequently, the returns on small Compustat companies are biased upward. The Center for Research and Securities Prices returns database do not have this bias \nbecause it includes all companies ever listed on the exchange and does not remove them should they \nfail. Kothari, Shanken, and Sloan found that the returns for the set of companies that were on CRSP \nbut not on Com pustat were, in fact, lower than the set of com panies that were on both data sets.\nWhat's the bottom line? It takes a better theory to kill an existing theory, and we have not seen the \nbetter theor y yet. Therefore, we continue to\n17 S. Kothari, J. Shanken, and R.

All continuing value approaches are based on \nan assumption of steady state performance. The explicit forecast period must be long enough so that \nthe company has reached a steady state by the end of this period. This steady state can be \ncharacterized as follows:\n\u2022 The company earns a constant rate of return on all new capital invested during the continuing \nvalue \nperiod.\n\u2022 The com pany earns a constant return on its base level of invested ca pital.\n\u2022 The company grows at a constant rate and reinvests a constant proportion of its operating profits in \nthe business each year.\nThe forecast should be long enough so that you are comfortable projecting growth in the continuing \nvalue period close to the rate of growth in the economy. Much higher growth would lead to companies becoming unrealistically large relative to the economy. We recommend using a forecast \nperiod of 10 to 15 years for most companies. Very high growth or cyclical companies may need an \neven longer time to reach a relatively mature stage. Using a short forecast period (3 to 5 years) will typically result in the significant undervaluation of a company or require heroic long-term growth assum\nptions in the continuin g value.\nSuch a long forecast period raises its own issues. Forecasting is predicting the future, which most of \nus can't do, especially not 10 to 15 years removed. To simplify the problem and avoid the error of false \nprecision, we often s plit the forecast into two periods:\n1. A detailed forecast for 3 to 5 years, where complete balance sheets and income statements are \ndevelo ped with as much linka ge to real variables as possible (e.g., unit volumes, cost per unit ).\n2. A simplified forecast for the remaining years, focusing on a few important variables, such as \nrevenue growth, mar gins, and ca pital turnover.\nIn addition to simplifying the forecast, this approach also forces you to focus on the long-term \neconomics of the business, not just the individual line items of the forecast.

One such stor y might be summarized as follows:\nDemand is increasing rapidly because of changing demographics, yet prices will remain stable because of the \ncompetitive structure of the industry. Given the company's competitive position, it should be able to increase its \nmarket share somewhat, although profitability will remain constant.\nThis story provides the context for the financial forecast. This story should be based on a thoughtful \nstrategic analysis of the company and its industry. There is an extensive strategy literature to help \nyou develop these stories; in this chapter, we will describe some of the analytical frameworks that \nyou could use.\nKeep in mind that what ultimately drives the value of the company is your assessment of whether \nand for how long a company can earn returns in excess of its opportunity cost of capital. To do this, companies must develop and exploit a competitive advantage. Without a competitive advantage, competition would force all the companies in the industry to earn only their cost of capital (or even less\n).\nCompetitive advantages that translate into a positive ROIC versus WACC spread can be categorized \nas:\n1. Providing superior value to the customer through a combination of price and product attributes \nthat cannot be replicated by competitors. These attributes can be tangible (the fastest computer) or \nintan gible (brands, co pyrights, patents ).\n2. Achievin g lower costs than com petitors.\n3.

In this model, four forces drive an industry's profit \npotential: substitute products, su pplier bar gainin g power, customer bar gainin g power, and entr y/exit barriers.\nThe existence of substitute products can place significant limits on an industry. For example, railroads and trucks compete for  the movement of freight. \nRail movement is relatively cheap for large, long hauls but is not as flexible and inexpensive as truck movement for small, sho rt hauls. For some \nshipments between the very long and very short, a shipper could use either rail or truck transportation and could try to create  bidding competitions \nbetween them.\nEntry and exit barriers determine the likelihood of competitors entering and leaving the industry. Entry barriers arise when th ere are skills or assets that \nonly a few competitors can obtain. Access to capital is rarely an entry barrier because it is easy to obtain. On the other hand , access to new technology \nand patents can shut out new competitors. Exit barriers exist when competitors are better off staying in the industry, even tho ugh they are not earning \ntheir cost of capital. Exit barriers often arise in capital intensive industries where companies may be earning more than their  marginal cost so they do \nnot wish to exit, but the returns on capital are low. Furthermore, management may continue to invest capital in low-return indu stries for long periods \nbecause the y do not wish to dismantle their or ganization or the y are ho ping other com petitors will leave first.\nThe bargaining power of suppliers determines what share of the total pool of customer revenues can be retained by the industry.  If a company can \nincrease its bargaining power, its share of the revenue will increase.

It also tells us how difficult it will be for a competitor to differentiate itself and helps to  identify how profitable each \ntype of customer is likel y to be, based on their needs and cost to serve.\nCustomer segmentation analysis works from two perspectives: the customer and the producer. From the customer perspective, produ ct attributes have \ndifferent importance to different groups of customers. After-sale service may be more important to a small manufacturing custom er than a large \ncustomer with its own in-house maintenance staff. In addition, competitors may include different attributes in their product of fering and, in this way, \ndeliver different benefits to customer groups.\nExhibit 11.2 Structure-Conduct-Performance Model", "start_char_idx": 4, "end_char_idx": 2286, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49532296-6248-459d-9177-49c8456d69c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "49532296-6248-459d-9177-49c8456d69c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "247", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "25bbeceb-a330-41f3-bd5a-994347f6e431", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "247", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "ada0816666b97a0d284bf0bbe91ae31aca4a3830bbf2a06bf8c63d386713aa38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "21166657-ccbc-4777-a922-db0a69090ebe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "4643363792e403f0fdc65fa2124c5239a47ee17bbb6d625d4425339fc7a18dc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "31691dc7-43cc-4fd2-a523-ed16e07734ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7dc5fc6269d7106295821c7dc7a33b6b55bb2f0a216bed6cc42f925721257207", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 238\nA customer segment is a group of customers to whom similar product attributes provide similar benefits. Segmenting customers fo rces the analyst to \nunderstand why customers prefer one product over another, often despite the fact that the products appear similar.

In the overni ght package delivery \nbusiness, for example, detailed billing information on each package is important to some customers, while others are content wi th summary data.

In the traditional model, each player competes at arm's length with its competitors, \ncustomers, and suppliers for a share of the total value. Co-dependent systems refer to industries where alliances, networks, and economic webs are critical elements of competition. Industries based on privileged relationships are characterized by companies providing special ''non-economic\" \ntreatment of each other because of common financial interests, friendship, political connections, or \nethnic lo\nyalty.\nAlong the basis-of-competition axis, the traditional model assumes that structural advantages \nprovide the source of extraordinary returns. Coyne and Subramaniam add two other sources of \nadvantage: front-line execution and insight/foresight. Some companies can beat the competition \nsimply by better execution of day-to-day tasks. This can sometimes overwhelm any structural advantage. Other companies can create value by consistently developing insights or knowledge ahead of the com\npetition.\nBringing together the three industry structures and the three sources of advantage provides a more \ncomplete picture of how a com pany can create value.\nTranslate the Strate gic Pers pective into Financial Forecast\nNow that you have your story about the company's future performance, you can translate it into a \nfinancial forecast. It is best to begin with an integrated income statement and balance sheet forecast. Free cash flow and ROIC can then be derived from the income statement and balance sheet.\nIt is possible to forecast free cash flow directly rather than going through the income statement and \nbalance sheet, but we do not recommend it. If you do not construct the balance sheet, it is easy to \nlose sight of how all the pieces fit together. An analyst doing a valuation tried to simplify the forecasting process by ignoring the balance sheet. The company's history showed that it usually generated about two dollars in sales for each dollar of net fixed assets. By the end of the analyst's \nforecast, however, the company was generating five dollars in sales for each dollar of net fixed \nassets. The analyst had not intended this result and did not even know it was happening, because a balance sheet and supporting ratios had not been constructed. The balance sheet also helps to identify the financing implications of the forecast. It shows how much capital must be raised or how much excess cash will be available.\nThe most common approach to forecasting the income statement and balance sheet for nonfinancial \ncompanies is a demand-driven forecast.

The stock \napproach would forecast end-of-year inventories as a function of the year's revenues. The flow \napproach would forecast the change in inventories as a function of the growth in revenues. We favor the stock approach. The relationship between the balance sheet accounts and revenues (or other volume measures) is more stable than the relationship between balance changes and changes in \nrevenues.\nConsider the example on Exhibit 11.5. The ratio of inventories to revenues remains within a small \nband of 9.6 percent to 10.4 percent, while the ratio of changes in inventories to changes in revenues ranges from 5 percent to 18 percent. Moreover, forecasting changes in inventories to be 15 percent \nto 18 \npercent of chan ges in revenues would lead to a substantial increase in inventories to revenues.\nThis issue is particularly acute for property, plant, and equipment.

For co nsistency, both the \nfinancial forecast and the cost of capital must be based on the same expected general inflation rate. This means that the infla tion rate built into the \nforecast must be derived from an inflation rate im plicit in the cost of ca pital.3\nThe expected general inflation rate implicit in the cost of capital can generally be derived from the term structure of governm ent bond rates.

For \nexample, the revenue forecast should reflect the growth in units sold and the expected increase in unit prices. The increase in  unit prices, in turn, should reflect the general \nexpected level of inflation in the economy plus or minus an inflation rate differential for that specific product.

First, these forecasts rarely \nextend beyond a couple of years. Second, they may not be consistent with the market's forecast embedded in the term structure of interest rates. Third, empirical analysis suggests that market-\nbased estimates are the least biased.4\nEstimatin g the real rate of interest is not eas y. Here are three a pproaches:\n1. Over the years 1926 through 1998, long-term government bonds in the United States returned 5.3 \npercent compounded annually, while inflation averaged 3.0 percent. Thus the real return from investin\ng in lon g-term government bonds was 2.2 percent.5\n2. Another historical approach is to examine yields (the income portion of the total return) on \ngovernment bonds versus realized inflation. Exhibit 11.6 shows the yield on 20-year government \nbonds less next year's inflation. The average real yield has increased significantly from about 2.0 percent from 1958 to 1972 to about 4.1 percent from 1987 to 1998 (ignoring the turbulent period from 1973 to 1986, when inflation and interest rates fluctuated wildl\ny).\n3. The U.S. government recently began issuing inflation-indexed bonds. In September 1999, the real \nyield on these bonds was about 4 percent (these were fairly stable over the prior year). For technical and tax reasons, some credit market analysts have suggested that these bonds are not liquid enough to represent a fair estimate of market expectations of real returns. As the market for these bonds \ndevelo\nps, these concerns ma y diminish.\nEach of these approaches has its drawbacks. In our experience, most valuations assume a real risk-\nfree rate of 3 percent to 4 percent.\n4 See E. Fama and M.

To maximize penetration into new markets, Heineken combines exports, licensed brewing, and acquiring production capacity and local brands.\n\u007f Packaging . Although Heineken standardizes images on beer labels to support brand awareness, it also tailors packaging to satisfy local c ustomers' tastes. This may add \nvariable costs, but the impact is more than offset by the success it enjoys penetrating markets.\n\u007f Distribution . The ownership of distribution varies by country, depending on market maturity and Heineken's strategy there.\n\u007f Marketing . Leveraging its brand is an important part of Heineken's success. Heineken is the most global player in the market; its beer c an be found in over 170 countries. \nHeineken bills its major brands (Heineken and Amstel) as premium products in non-European markets, and as mainstream products i n European markets. It segments \nmarketing and advertising campaigns to capture as much premium as possible. Finally, it reinvests much of its retained earnings  in advertising and brand development in \neach country.\nHeineken enhances this business strategy with an aggressive acquisition program. The company has purchased various producers an d distributors since its major expansion \nin Europe during the 1980s. Its acquisitions since Van Munching & Co. (its U.S. distributor and marketer) in 1991 include Sorgy ar (Hungarian brewer), Interbrew Italia, \nZalty Bazant (Slovakia), Birra Moretti (Italy), Fischer and Saint-Arnould (France), and Zywiec (Poland). It has enjoyed more gr owth through acquisition than any other \nmajor brewer except Interbrew (Exhibit 11.14).\nExhibit 11.15 shows that this globalization and acquisition strategy has helped cement Heineken's place as a solid competitor i n all major regions around the world, though it \nenjoys top market share only in Europe (1997 market shares).\nGiven that two or three players usually dominate each regional market (or country), we can see that Heineken is strongly positi oned in Europe and Africa, an d", "start_char_idx": 4, "end_char_idx": 2095, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ada8dcb-3355-4c1c-869a-afa5c3e0e898": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ada8dcb-3355-4c1c-869a-afa5c3e0e898", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "260", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["Corona", "United States", "Americas", "Anheuse r-Busch", "Miller", "Heineken", "Coors", "North America", "Asia-Pacific"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "07cc68fb-8fb7-455a-a9d9-48fa644d5524", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "260", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "c6b0315e017d1daeb5a800dcfc53ea38b3d63b06ac2cc037e6e0f53cfcc911e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "431a5bda-6aaf-49fa-b46e-5d6f6ea8f128", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "259", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "a120bf5269f11b6891321a4a36d53ef5073deda1dbd86c4a59140bf6121f3aea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "84d1eb46-158b-4a78-828f-c304976669f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b02f1caf980847f2ce2969d199115b8450be8376e2f2bea39c365ba346168a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 251\nExhibit 11.14 Percentage of Current Volume Achieved through Acquisition Since 19901\nmore weakly positioned in the Americas and Asia-Pacific.

Most markets have consolidated, so apart from a megamerger, all \nthe integrators can look forward to is the relatively slow growth that can be squeezed out organically or through minor acquisitions.\nAt the moment, no major player is willing to give up its independence. That may not always be the case, so \nthere is considerable uncertainty. We developed three performance scenarios:\n1. Business as usual . The industry avoids major price wars, and overall industry returns on capital slightly \nimprove. Heineken's performance is the same as in the late 1990s, and the company makes two major acquisitions and some small ones in the near future. The company continues to globalize and captures a market \nshare of 6.6 percent by 2003 versus 6.1 percent in 1998. Given this picture, we forecast stable, value-creating \ngrowth, with margins and returns on invested capital remaining relatively flat.\n2. Price war . The industry price wars started by Miller and Busch continue worldwide, dropping returns toward \nthe cost of capital. Heineken's performance is stable, but with weaker margins and no new acquisitions.\n3. Market discipline/industry consolidation . The industry consolidates and avoids price wars. Heineken \nimproves gross and EBITA margins through an aggressive mergers-and-acquisitions program. It becomes a \nleader in the drive for industry consolidation.\nFor the remainder of this chapter and in Chapter 12 (Continuing Value), we will only analyze in detail the \nBusiness as Usual scenario. The resulting valuations of the other two scenarios will be covered in Chapter 13.\nForecast Individual Line Items for the Shor t-Term Horizon\nWe offer a 15-year forecast to allow a sufficient period for the industry strategic game to play out and for Heineken to reach a steady-state financial performance. A detailed forecast was prepared for the first five years, and a condensed forecast is used for the remaining 10 years. This forecast is driven by demand; in other words, \nmost income statement and balance sheet line items are derived from the sales forecast. The detailed \nprojections for the first five years are laid out in Exhibits 11.16 and 11.17.\nRevenues\nThere are several ways to model revenue growth that allow it to be broken down into its major parts. A Merrill \nLynch investment report in December 1998 provided one such model, which we adapted for forecasting purposes. In this model, revenue growth is a function of volume growth, average price changes (price per unit \nor changing product mix), and acquisitions.\nFor the Business-as-Usual scenario, we forecast Heineken's underlying volume growth to average 1.5 percent \nper year (excluding acquisitions), somewhat lowe r", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2754, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf5e7fb4-5298-4085-bb98-7e8621e0d95b": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf5e7fb4-5298-4085-bb98-7e8621e0d95b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "262", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["Heineken"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c44ce90d-49fa-446f-840e-aaa32d12da39", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "262", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "cf04ae3e39ae07670727ec5535108279e2475da8ccf761beaf87add58d1c18b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "84d1eb46-158b-4a78-828f-c304976669f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "261", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "e5744413f52441c9f5a972d5a44cd751f932c2050b6fc4d945a51b56c4c40787", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fc42d038-32a6-4797-b08e-d276705e9182", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b06592e71259f2ed8732fb93b4d7d75cfe52dacd3d1e447b128429b082c0c3e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 253\nExhibit 11.16 Heineken\u2014Short-Term Financial Forecast\nthan the industry because of Heineken's stronger presence in the slower growing developed markets.

In the years 1994 to 1998, depreciation was between 11 percent and 14 percent \nof net plant, property, and equipment. We assume that depreciation remains constant as a percentage of net \nproperty, plant, and equipment, given the slow growth and industrial nature of the business.\nFinancin g Costs\nThe annual report provides the amortization schedule for Heineken's existing debt. We create new debt or marketable securities in our forecast to balance the sources and uses of cash. For simplicity, we estimate interest expense based on the level of debt at the beginning of that year, rather than on the average level of \ndebt. We forecast the interest rate on existing debt as 8.5 percent, the same as the effective rate in 1998. The \nrate on new debt and retirement-related liability is the opportunity cost of borrowing, 4.3 percent. We use the interest rate on short-term treasury bills in the Netherlands to estimate the interest rate on excess marketable \nsecurities.\nTaxes\nWe estimate Heineken's marginal tax rate as 35 percent, the statutory tax rate in the Netherlands. Heineken's \nEBITA effective tax rate has historically been close to the marginal tax rate, between 33 percent and 36 \npercent, with the exception of the heavy acquisition years. So we use 1998's effective tax rate of 33.8 percent to \nforecast effective cash taxes.\nWorkin g Capital\nOperating working capital is comprised of operating cash, accounts receivable, inventories, and other current assets (such as prepaid expenses) less accounts payable, and other current liabilities (such as taxes payable). It does not include short-term sources of funds such as short-term debt or dividends payable. Between 1994 and \n1998, net working capital was about 3 percent of revenues, with the exception of 1996 and 1997 (which were \nacquisition years). The only significant change in any single line item seems to be other current liabilities. We believe this will revert to a normal level of about 11.8 percent of revenues, generating a forecasted level of working capital of 3.3 percent of revenues.\nIn general, consider the following when forecasting working capital:\n\u007f Does the company's acquisition (or other growth) strategy affect its need for working capital?\n\u007f How much working cash does this company generally need to operate (we assume 2 percent of revenue in this \ncase; for most industrial companies it is between 1 percent and 2 percent of revenue)?", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2592, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "530e808c-350b-44d2-bb50-73c09189a739": {"__data__": {"id_": "530e808c-350b-44d2-bb50-73c09189a739", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["E quipment Property", "Plant"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "56568da8-f9fe-46e5-8951-5c59d7c73b36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "7c03120c9eb940dfea03126f7cdba0c0338e26a3e1bf4854ae3e1895f232b493", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "21bcfc5d-de9b-4627-b556-3b8aae30ecc0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "264", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "05246bef80f4409d6b56c50e49bcb1fa80d43d7c4fceba95f68abc47f942768a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e828c50-5f91-49c8-8416-d63455e8e749", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "536a519d83c932cacaa5a6f0105ba9442b55e3279c2f30be9055de4fb183015f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 256\n\u007f Does the company plan to reduce working capital in the near future? If there is a clear trend in working \ncapital, will this trend continue or stabilize?\nYear-end working capital can be volatile simply because it is measured on the last day of the year. Average \nmeasures are probably more stable, yet generally not available. So do not give too much weight to minor year-\nto-year fluctuations. Focus instead on major trends.\nNet Pro perty, Plant, and E quipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment are more difficult to forecast than other line items because revenues, costs, and working capital are generally equally affected by inflation. PPE are not. The bottom-up approach of forecasting \nindividual expenditures (new and replacement) may be the most accurate approach, but can usually only be done from within the company.\nWe use a simpler approach to forecasting PPE. We make an assumption about the steady-state amount of net \nPPE it takes to generate each dollar of sales. This is supported by the observation that Heineken's net PPE-to-\nrevenues have remained flat. The only major change in this ratio occurred when the company made acquisitions in 1996. (Before 1996, it was 45 percent; since the acquisitions it has been 41 percent.) We forecast that net PPE will remain the same as in 1998, which is about the same as the average for 1996 to 1998. \nThese assumptions probably would not hold for a high growth company or in an inflationary environment.\nWe will also assume that fixed assets are used until they are fully depreciated and that they have no material \nscrap value. So the amount of assets retired from gross plant, property, and equipment each year will equal the amount of the reduction in accumulated depreciation. We have set this level at 1 percent.\nDividends\nLet's assume that dividends remain the same percentage of net income as in 1998. As a result, Heineken would build up large amounts of excess cash, given its high cash flow and little debt. To avoid this, we have projected \nthat Heineken will eventually distribute excess cash to shareholders. If Heineken were a U.S. company, we \nwould assume that it would repurchase shares. As a Dutch company, Heineken's ability to repurchase shares is limited. Instead we assume that Heineken periodically pays out a large special dividend. (Unilever, a major Anglo-Dutch company, began paying out a similar special dividend in 1998.) These dividends are declared in \nthe second and fifth years of the forecast.\nOther\nDutch companies can write off goodwill as it is incurred, rather than amortizing it, as is the case in the United States. Thus, we forecast that Heineken will write off goodwill immediately upon acquiring another company. \nWe assume that Heineken will pay a market-to-book value of 2 for acquisitions, and thus would incur goodwill equal to the book value of assets taken on.

As we stated earlier, a company's expected \ncash flow can be se parated into two periods and the com pany's value defined as follows:\nThe second term is the continuing value . It is the value of the company's expected cash flow beyond \nthe explicit forecast period. Using simplifying assumptions about the company's performance during \nthis period\u2014for example, assuming a constant rate of growth\u2014permits us to estimate continuing \nvalue with one of several formulas. Using a continuing value formula eliminates the need to forecast in detail the com\npany's cash flow over an extended period.\nA high-quality estimate of continuing value is essential to any valuation, because continuing value \noften accounts for a large percentage of the total value of the company. Exhibit 12.1 shows continuing value as a percentage of total value for companies in four industries (given an eight-year explicit forecast). In these examples, continuing value accounts for 56 percent to 125 percent of total value.

With a forecast horizon of five years, the present value of the continuing value ac counts for 79 percent of \ntotal value, while with a 10- year horizon, the present value of continuin g value accounts for onl y 60 percent of total value.\nThe choice of forecast horizon can have an indirect impact on value if it is associated with changes in the economic assumption s underlying the \ncontinuing value estimate. Analysts often unknowingly change their performance forecasts when they change their forecast horizo n. Many forecasters \nassume that the rate of return on new invested capital equals the cost of capital in the continuing value period, but that the company will earn returns \nexceeding the cost of capital during the explicit forecast period. When they extend the explicit forecast period, they also ext end the time period during \nwhich returns on new capital are expected to exceed the cost of capital.

A naive, and incorrect, forecast for Year 11 (the continuing value base year) simply increases every cash flo w from Year 10 by 5 \npercent, as shown in the third column. This forecast is wrong because the increase in working capital is far too large for the increase in sales. Since \nsales are growing more slowly, the proportion of gross cash flow devoted to increasing working capital should decline significa ntly, as shown in the \nlast column. In the last column, the increase in working capital is the amount necessary to maintain the year-end working capit al at a constant \npercentage of sales.

Liquidation value is often far different from \nthe value of the company as a going concern. In a growing, profitable industry, a company's \nliquidation value is probably far below the going-concern value. In a dying industry, liquidation \nvalue may exceed going-concern value. Do not use this approach unless liquidation is likely at the end of the forecast \nperiod.\nThe replacement-cost approach  sets the continuing value equal to the expected cost to replace the \ncompany's assets. This approach has a number of drawbacks. First, only tangible assets are replaceable. The company's ''organizational capital\" can be valued only on the basis of the cash flow the company generates. The replacement cost of the company's tangible assets may greatly understate the value of the com\npany.\nSecond, not all the company's assets will ever be replaced. Consider a machine used only by this \nparticular industry. The replacement cost of the asset may be so high that it is not economical to replace it. As long as it generates a positive cash flow, the asset is valuable to the ongoing business \nof the company. Here, the replacement cost may exceed the value of the business as an ongoing \nentit\ny.\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio approach assumes the company will be worth some multiple of its \nfuture earnings in the continuing period. Of course, this will be true; the difficulty arises in trying to \nestimate an a ppropriate P/E ratio.\nSuppose today's current industry average P/E ratio is chosen. Today's P/E ratio reflects the \neconomic prospects of the industry during the explicit forecast period as well as the continuing value period. However, prospects at the end of the explicit forecast period are likely to be very \ndifferent from today's. We need a different P/E ratio that reflects the company's prospects at the end \nof the forecast period. What factors will determine that ratio? As we discussed in Chapter 8, the company's expected growth, the rate of return on new capital, and the cost of capital are the primary determinants of its P/E ratio. These are the same factors that are in the value driver formula. So \nunless you are comfortable using an arbitrary P/E ratio, you are much better off with the value \ndriver formula.\nWhen valuing acquisitions, companies sometimes fall into the circular reasoning that the P/E ratio \nfor the continuing value will equal the P/E ratio paid for the acquisition. In other words, if I pay 18 \ntimes earnings, I should be able to sell the business for 18 times earnings. In most cases, the reason \na company is willing to pay a high P/E for an acquisition is that it believes it can take actions to greatly improve earnings. So the effective P/E it is paying on the improved level of earnings will be much less than 18. Once the improvements are in place and earnings are higher, buyers will not be \nwillin\ng to pay the same P/E unless the y can make additional im provements.\nThe market-to-book ratio approach  assumes the company will be worth some multiple of its book \nvalue, often the same as its current multiple or the multiples of comparable companies.

You might assume that during the first eight years after the explicit forecast period that the company would grow at 8 percent per year and earn an incremental ROIC of 15 percent. After those eight years, the company's growth would slow to 5 percent and incremental ROIC would dro\np to 11 percent:\nwhere N   = The number of years in the first sta ge of the continuin g value period.\ngA   = The expected growth rate in the first stage of the CV period.\ngB   = The expected growth in the second stage of the CV period.\nROICA   = The expected incremental ROIC during the first stage of the CV period.\nROICB   = The expected incremental ROIC during the second stage of the CV \nperiod.\nNote that gB must be less than WACC for this formula to be valid (otherwise the company would \neventuall y take over the entire world econom y).\nA two-sta ge economic profit continuin g value formula follows:2\nwhere all the variables are defined as in the earlier e quations.\n2 Thanks to Pieter de Wit and David Krieger for deriving this formula.", "start_char_idx": 4, "end_char_idx": 1562, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fb352f8-2e57-4e77-ba6e-b13294b76e60": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fb352f8-2e57-4e77-ba6e-b13294b76e60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "294", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "298c4132-0003-4650-b491-26df74dbedcb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "294", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "20982c3e134c20ec511608f3af051529551af9156e205b6142bece82143331c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1310d1b4-c3cb-454f-8529-9773504c01fb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "293", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "10715aeeb93d380f287e2ce44acb6495467458b463d7370046835068e95794e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c62044a5-0df4-47cc-ac86-73ecc83d3ffe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5191a42559b6b2bdc3293117961c453be9a2909e6357c45b1ab9f2241d74b71a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 286\nHere is a two-sta ge formula that builds in a decline in incremental ROIC durin g the first sta ge:3\nWhere \u03b1 is the rate of decrease in ROIC and is given b y the followin g formula:\nIn all these formulas, the ROIC referred to is the incremental ROIC on net new investment. The \nassumption is always made in these formulas that the return on the base level of capital remains constant at the level of the last \nyear of the ex plicit forecast.\nIf you want to model a decline in ROIC for all capital, including the base level of capital, it is best to \nmodel that into the explicit forecast. This is difficult to model with formulas because the growth rate in revenues and NOPLAT will not equal the growth rate in FCF and there are multiple ways for the ROIC to decline. ROIC could decline by setting the growth rate for capital and reducing NOPLAT \nover time (in which case NOPLAT will grow much slower than capital). Or you could set the \ngrowth rate for NOPLAT and adjust FCF each period (once again FCF growth will be slower than \nNOPLAT growth).

We first performed a sensitivity analysi s on growth, EBITA margin, capital \nturnover, and WACC. Exhibit 13.7 summarizes the results. We see that, aside from changing WACC, a change in EBITA margin and gr owth has greater relative impact on \nthe equity value of Heineken than capital turnover.

Multibusiness valuation is useful for several \npurposes, not the least of which is simply understanding the business. Strategic decisions for most multibusiness companies take place at the business-unit level. Thorough understanding of the company requires careful analysis of the threats and opportunities faced by each business unit. A company valuation built from separate valuations of business units provides much deeper insight \nthan a company valuation that looks at the organization as a whole. The separate valuation of \nbusiness units is at the heart of value- based mana gement.\nMultibusiness valuation is also useful for determining whether a company is more valuable as a \ncombination of businesses or whether it is more valuable if the units are operated as stand-alone \nentities. It helps to create a clearer picture of headquarters costs and benefits since headquarters can be valued as if it were a separate cost center. The central question is usually whether the benefits of head\nquarters exceed the costs or if some of the extra la yers of overhead can be trimmed.\nThe burden of proof is on management. The most current evidence suggests that conglomerates are \nvalued lower by the market than comparable pure play companies. In the study most often cited on the subject, Berger and Ofek\n1 estimated the conglomerate discount to be about 15 percent, based on \na study of more than 3,500 companies from 1986 to 1991.

What makes multibusiness valuation more complex \nis that each business unit has its own cash flows, capital structure, and cost of capital. In addition, business units may have  shared cash flows and it may \nbe hard to se parate the costs and benefits of cor porate head quarters.\nValuing a multibusiness company is somewhat like putting together building blocks. The value of the entire corporation is the s um of the value of the \nbusiness units, plus nonoperating assets, less the unallocated costs of corporate headquarters.

A good rule of thumb is to define business \nunits at the smallest practical level of aggregation.

Plastics and fuels are joint products from a single \nchemical plant. This same plant produces synthetic rubber as a by-product that is used for the \nmanufacture of bicycle tires. How should business units be defined? How shall we handle the joint \nproduct and b y-product problems?\nAs Exhibit 14.1 suggests, the easiest solution is to create two business units. The first combines the \njoint products\u2014plastics and fuels\u2014under a single roof. This is advisable because they are produced \nin a single facility and because their production is interdependent. Management of the business unit must maximize value by choosing the best output mix of plastics and fuels given market demand, production constraints for the two products, and the cost of their inputs. The general principle is to combine \njoint products (interde pendent or contin gent products ) into a sin gle business unit.\nThe second business unit produces bicycles. It is clearly independent of business unit 1 except for \nthe fact that a by-product of business unit 1, synthetic rubber, is an input for the bicycle division. However, synthetic rubber could be acquired from another supplier. Hence, the bicycle division is \nlogically separable as a business unit. Synthetic rubber can be ''sold,\" at a market-determined \ntransfer price, by business unit 1 to business unit 2. If the transfer price is not acceptable to business unit 2, it should be allowed to \npurchase s ynthetic rubber from a third party.\nTo identify business-unit cash flows, we deal with two typical problems: transfer pricing and \ncorporate overhead. Transfer pricing arises when the output of one business unit is the input of \nanother. A high price will increase profits of the supplier at the expense of the user, and vice versa. The recommended solution is to establish a transfer price as close as possible to the market price of close substitutes. This can be a difficult task if substitutes are hard to find. The main idea is to approximate market prices so that profit is appropriately allocated to the supplier or to the user of \nthe \ngoods or service.\nTaxation often complicates transfer pricing. One of the benefits of the corporate umbrella (that is, of \nheadquarters) is that it can establish a transfer-pricing system that keeps profits in the jurisdiction \nthat has the lowest tax burden. As a result, one set of artificial transfer prices may be used for tax \npurposes and another set of market-determined prices for determining business-unit cash flows (although tax authorities may not permit this). This topic is covered in Chapter 17, where we discuss valuin\ng forei gn subsidiaries.\nAllocating corporate overhead is a problem closely related to transfer pricing. The central issue is \nwhether business units would use corporate services if they were spun off as separate entities. Many services would be used; for example, accounting, legal, computer, and internal consulting services. Whenever possible, the cost of these services should be allocated to business units on a usage basis \nor, failin\ng that, on the basis of a reasonable", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 3148, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0cf923c-243a-4792-a311-91059aef71fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0cf923c-243a-4792-a311-91059aef71fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "309", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e341d2a-c5cf-4791-97c7-cdfc0c967863", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "309", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "73bf93d1d27538b9cc56fafc3e6e9d5601a28181fa6240920efd1a9e07888c45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "036bc03e-7463-45fe-9ced-3701c28e933a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "308", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "edd3e428c884ba8abde2435d57d3a4b8ddfe6fc895b6f9dcd50b343916a7868b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2157942-0aaf-4359-ac46-d9df5e9e8838", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5dce3e77fbe4e89940c003e2716d15d25d2e1d6e78de8ce5b7adbc60215ea795", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 304\nproxy for usa ge, such as o peratin g income, revenues, ca pital em ployed, or number of em ployees.\nIn theory, market prices should be used for allocation purposes. For example, one hour of a \nheadquarters accountant's time should be billed to a division based on the market price of accountants' time in general\u2014that is, at the opportunity cost to the division. Any difference between the market price and the actual salary paid to the accountant by headquarters is a benefit or a cost to \nheadquarters.

Determining these costs and benefits is a difficult exercise. At one extreme, headquarters is merely an extra level of \nexpense, and great value can be obtained by breaking up the business units, selling them, and \ndemolishing corporate headquarters. At the opposite extreme, headquarters can be too lean for its optimal role as agent for the capital markets in getting the highest performance from the business units, as well as capital allocation, risk management, and tax planning.

We have divided them into \ntwo broad categories: those that are quantifiable, and others that, while important, are extremely difficult to measure.\nBenefits that can be quantified (with difficulty) are tax advantages and greater debt capacity. Tax \nadvantages attributable to headquarters arise primarily from the lack of an adequate secondary market for tax shields. A group of business units with highly variable year-to-year taxable earnings can share tax shields by operating under a corporate umbrella. The losses of unit A can be used \nimmediately to shelter the gains of unit B, so the business unit does not have to wait for tax carry-\nforwards or carry-backs. Conglomerates constructed from business units with low taxable-income variability are likely to benefit less from a corporate tax umbrella than conglomerates built from diverse business units with hi\nghly variable income.\nHeadquarters also provides the benefit of the present value of tax shelters that arise from corporate-\nlevel tax planning. In addition to the ability to use tax losses immediately, corporate headquarters is often able to undertake international tax planning (for example, transfer pricing) that might not be available were the business units o\nperatin g separatel y.\nFinally, greater debt capacity is created because business-unit cash flows are not perfectly \ncorrelated. Once the capital structure for each business unit has been developed and business-unit debt has been totaled, a portion attributable to headquarters might yet remain. (See the discussion of determining business-unit capital structure and cost of capital that follows for more on how to \nallocate debt to business units.) The present value of the tax shield arising from this debt is a benefit \nof head\nquarters. If the com pany owes no cor porate-level taxes, this benefit eva porates.\nBenefits that are not easily measured include prospective synergies and information advantages. \nOperating synergies are an obvious benefit of combining business units. If the company makes an \nacquisition that allows the existing salesforce to assume the duties of the target's salesforce, the present value of the realized savings is a benefit due, at least initially, to headquarters if headquarters recommended the acquisition and subsequent combination of the two businesses. The vision of headquarters is not part of continuing operations and, although valuable, impossible to \nforecast as \npart of cash flows.\nInformation and communications advantages complete the list of headquarter's benefits. Although \ndifficult to quantify, they can be important.

As mentioned earlier, when a business unit is separated from the parent, it loses its ability to shelter taxable income with losses elsewhere in the parent and must resort to tax carry-forwards and tax carry-back provisions of the tax code. This consideration is also relevant \nwhen deciding whether to spin off a unit or to sell it to another company. A simple spin-off may \nincrease the unit's tax rate, whereas sale to another company that can shelter the unit's earnings may be preferable. Effective tax rates may change for less obvious reasons. For example, tax advantages of transfer pricing or multinational taxation may be different if a business unit is separated from the \nparent.\nSince we are treating corporate headquarters as a separate business unit for valuation purposes, its \neffect on taxes must also be estimated. In most cases, headquarters (the corporate umbrella) is a means for generating tax shelters; hence, its implied tax rate is negative. The present value of \nhead\nquarters tax shelters is a benefit to the com pany.\nEstimatin g Business-Unit Ca pital Structure and Cost o f Capital\nThe capital structure of each business unit should be consistent with that of comparable companies \nin its industry and with the overall philosophy of its parent. If the parent is aggressive and chooses a \nBaa bond rating, then business units will normally have capital structures that bring them a Baa rating within their industry. At that rating, different business units may be able to borrow varying amounts of debt. An insurance subsidiary may be able to carry an 80 percent debt-to-capital ratio, while a manufacturing subsidiary might only have a 25 percent debt-to-capital ratio. The basis for \ndetermining business-unit capital structure will usually depend on cash flow or capital employed at \nthe business unit. Debt-to-capital ratios or interest-coverage ratios for comparable companies are a useful startin\ng point.\nThe difference between the sum of all business-unit debt and total companywide debt should be \nattributed to corporate headquarters. Any remaining debt results from the fact that the debt capacity of a portfolio of business-unit cash flows that are not perfectly correlated has less variance than the sum of the separate cash flows. Consequently, the combination of separate business units under a corporate umbrella provides greater debt capacity. The present value of the interest tax shield is a \nbenefit of head quarters.\nHaving determined the target capital structure and tax rate of each business unit, you still need to \nestimate the cost of equity to establish its weighted average cost of capital.

To estimate a beta, we recommend using one of three approaches: management compariso ns; comparison \ncompanies, or a multi ple regression.\nMana gement Com parisons\nA crude but often effective way of estimating betas is to elicit the help of management. Have three to five managers sit down a nd position the division \nor project being analyzed relative to a list of industries and their betas (see Exhibit 14.3 for example). You do not need to s how managers the actual \nbetas, or even to explain the concept. Just have a few of them suggest the industry with risk closest to their division. If the y all agree (and they usually \ndo), you will have a reasonable estimate of the levered beta of the division.\nCom parison Com panies\nA second approach is to identify the publicly traded competitors most similar to the division. You can then look up the betas f or these companies, \nwhich are presumed  to have similar risk. But there is a catch. Beta is a measure of the systematic risk of the levered equity of the comparison \ncompanies, and these companies may employ leverage differently from that used by the division you are attempting to value. To g et around this \nproblem, you have to unlever the betas of the comparison companies to obtain their business risk, then relever using the target  capital structure of the \ndivision you are anal yzing.\nThe unlevered beta measures the business risk of a company by removing the effect of financial leverage. The observed equity be ta computed from \nmarket return data presents a picture of the risk of equity given the company's existing leverage.

Sometimes a \ncompany's strategic plan implies that risk is expected to change. A young company, recently gone public, is risky now (high beta), but is expected to have declining risk across time.

Thus, cash flows must be defined as expected cash flows from non-interest tax shields. The appropriate discount rate for transfer-pricing \ntax shields depends on the business risk of the company.

This method is difficult to use because dividends are \ndiscretionar y and, therefore, difficult to forecast.\nDouble counting can occur when an undervalued asset is carried on the books of a business unit. For \nexample, paper companies sometimes own thousands of acres of timberland that is carried on the \nbooks at low value. An almost irresistible temptation is to estimate the market value of the forest \nand add it to the present value of cash flow. To do so would be double counting because expected cash flow already assumes that harvested trees will be used to produce lumber. They are, in every sense, an inventory. As with inventory, their value is not added, because it is already included in future cash flow as an in\nput to production.\nAnother common example of double counting is corporate headquarters or other real estate carried \nat low book value. The rental opportunity cost of the buildings is already reflected in a cash flow that is higher than it might otherwise be if the company were to sell its headquarters, then lease the \noffice space. You cannot have it both ways. Either discount the cash flow as it is, or subtract the \nex\npected rental cost from the cash flow and add the market value of the head quarters buildin g.\nExcess marketable securities build up in the projected balance sheet of a business unit if it is doing \nwell or, alternately, if debt is increased. This effect is a normal part of the forecasting process and, \nas discussed in Chapter 11, it has no effect on the present value of a business unit. Excess cash held \nby the company at the start of the valuation period is a different matter. It should not be allocated to \nbusiness units. Its value should simply be kept separate and added to the other corporate level values \ndurin g the a ggregation sta ge.\nConclusion\nValuing a multibusiness company by components often leads to a critical rethinking about what \nbusiness units really belong as part of the company, as we described in Chapter 2. Frequently managers will decide to restructure the company and focus on a smaller scope of activities. \nManagers are then faced with how to dispose of units that no longer fit. Over the past decade or so, \nthe choice of restructuring techniques has widened as different techniques have been perfected and accepted by the stock markets. In addition to selling a business unit to another company, managers can now choose among spin-offs, equity carve-outs, tracking stock, and management buyouts.\n4 \nValuation is a key tool for managers to use to determine what is best for their shareholders among \nall the o ptions.\n4 For a discussion of the various breakup techniques, see P.

This hypergrowth, when fueled by investments that have to be expensed (through the \nincome statement) rather than capitalized (on the balance sheet), will create ever increasing losses \nuntil growth rates slow.\nInternet companies typically don't require heavy investments of the type that get capitalized, such as \nfactories. Indeed, total investment for a full-featured, e-commerce-enabled Web site runs \nsomewhere between $3 million and $5 million. That is not to say that e-commerce start-ups don't need heavy investment, but their investment is in customer acquisition, which has to be expensed through the income statement. For example, if the acquisition cost per customer, through advertising and direct mail of CD-ROMs, is about $40 per customer and a company successfully builds its \ncustomer base from one million in year one, to three million in year two, to six million in year three, \nits ac\nquisition costs will rise from $40 million in year one to $120 million in year three.\nAnother way to illustrate this phenomenon is by comparing a ''bricks-and-mortar\" retailer with an e-\ncommerce retailer. In the bricks and mortar case, much of the customer acquisition cost consists of \nsecuring the store location, construction, and furniture and fixtures. These items are largely capitalized and expensed over their useful life. In the case of the virtual retailer, almost all customer acquisition costs are expensed. The physical retailer will break even many years earlier than the virtual retailer, even if they have identical cash flows! Provided the virtual retailer will earn a \npositive net present value on its customer acquisition investments, increasing losses because of \nacceleratin\ng customer ac quisition will raise the value of the com pany.\nOne thing is certain, though. These conditions of supernormal growth and investment through the \nincome statement render short-hand valuation approaches, including price-to-earnings and revenue \nmultiples, meaningless. Some analysts have suggested benchmarks such as price per customer or \nmultiples of revenues three or five years out. These approaches are fundamentally flawed as high growth, if the company succeeds, is likely to continue for another 5 to 10 years. More important, these short-hand methods can't account for the uniqueness of each company in this rapidly evolving \nspace. Indeed, one of the key reasons for skepticism about Internet valuations is the tendency to \na\npply these t ypes of valuation shortcuts.\nThe best way of valuing Internet companies is to return to economic fundamentals with the DCF \napproach, which makes the distinction between expensed and capitalized investment unimportant \nbecause accounting treatments don't affect cash flows. The absence of meaningful historical data \nand positive earnings to serve as the basis for price-to-earning multiples also doesn't matter, because the DCF a\npproach relies", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 3026, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3f79e47-a92f-4187-b01d-ce56ed2fffa3": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3f79e47-a92f-4187-b01d-ce56ed2fffa3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "321", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["Amazon.com"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "beae813f-090b-488a-a958-2f2ca05fe23f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "321", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "72753c56588bbc675e85e54ec6bea41e0d4c4d8fb4abf0f6f5c459becf2f84bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e99e671d-a3ca-453d-8cc4-52cee2f0494d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "320", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "94f7e4afda9bf9222fb7ada01f91e55336fa7b2ffad563cb58e666f93bb9d82d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "600dedc8-a1c1-49bf-a9e6-cb8b6eb91837", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "569054ae179068ac36448a341c149b793d6c832b58dad7f93c4d1c65a8b9e1ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 317\nsolely on forecasts of performance and can easily capture the worth of value-creating businesses that \nhave several years of initial losses. The DCF approach can't eliminate the need to make difficult \nforecasts, but it does address the problems of ultrahigh growth rates and uncertainty in a coherent \nway.\nWe focus on the three twists required to make DCF more useful for valuing Internet companies: \nstarting from a fixed point in the future and working back to the present, using probability-weighted \nscenarios to address high uncertainty in an explicit way, and exploiting classic analytical techniques to understand the underlying economics of these companies and to forecast their future \nperformance.\nWe will illustrate this approach with a valuation of Amazon.com, the archetypal Internet company, \nas of November 1999. In the four years from its launch to October 1999, it built a customer base of 10 million and expanded its offerings from books to compact discs, videos, digital video discs, toys, consumer electronics goods, and auctions. In addition, Amazon.com invested in branded Internet \nplayers such as pets.com and drugstore.com, and beginning in September 1999 it allowed other \nretailers to sell their wares on its Web site through an associates program. The company has become a symbol of the new economy; market research showed that in 1999 101 million people in the United States reco\ngnized the Amazon.com brand name.\nAll this activity was rewarded with a high market capitalization: $25 billion as of mid-November \n1999. Yet Amazon.com had never made a profit and lost $390 million in 1999. The company \nbecame the focus of a debate about whether Internet stocks were greatly overvalued.\nStart from the Future\nIn forecasting the performance of high-growth companies like Amazon.com, don't be constrained by \ncurrent performance. Instead of starting from the present\u2014the usual practice in DCF valuations\u2014start by thinking about what the industry and the company could look like when they evolve from today's very high-growth, unstable condition to a sustainable, moderate growth state in the future, \nand then extrapolate back to current performance. The future growth state should be defined by \nmetrics such as the penetration rate, average revenue per customer, and sustainable gross margins. Just as important as the characteristics of the industry and company in this future state is the point when it actually begins. Since Internet-related companies are new, more stable economics probably lie at least 10 to 15 \nyears in the future.\nBut consider what Amazon.com had already achieved. Its ability to enter and dominate categories is \nunprecedented, both in the off- and the online worlds. In 1998, for example, it took the company just three months to banish CDNow to second \nplace amon g online purveyors of music.

Suppose that Amazon.com were the next \nWal-Mart, another retailer that has radically changed its industry and taken a significant share of sales in its target markets. Say that by 2010, Amazon.com continues to be the leading online retailer \nand has established itself as the overall leading retailer, both off- and online, in certain markets. If \nthe company could take a 13 percent and 12 percent share of the total U.S. book and music markets, respectively, and captured a roughly comparable share of some other markets, it would have revenues of $60 billion in 2010, when Wal-Mart's revenues will probably have exceeded $300 \nbillion.\nWhat operating profit margin could Amazon.com earn on that $60 billion? The superior market \nshare of the company is likely to give it significant purchasing power. Remember, too, that Amazon.com will earn revenues and incur few associated costs from other retailers using its site. In \nthis optimistic scenario, Amazon.com, with an average operating margin in the 11 percent range, \nwould most likel\ny do a bit better than most other retailers.\nAnd what about capital? In the optimistic scenario, Amazon.com may well need less working \ncapital and fewer fixed assets than traditional retailers do. In almost any scenario, it should need less \ninventory because it can consolidate its stock-in-trade in a few warehouses, and it won't need retail \nstores at all. We assume that Amazon.com's 2010 capital turnover (revenues divided by the sum of workin\ng capital and fixed assets ) will be 3.4, com pared with 2.5 for t ypical retailers.\nCombining these assumptions gives us the following financial forecast for 2010: revenues, $60 \nbillion; operating profit, $7 billion; total capital, $18 billion. We also assume that Amazon.com will \ncontinue to grow by about 12 percent a year for the next 15 years after 2010 and that its growth will decline to 5.5 percent a year in perpetuity after 2025, slightly exceeding the nominal growth rate of the gross domestic product.\n1 To estimate Amazon.com's current value, we discount the projected \nfree cash flows back to the present. Their present value, including the estimated value of cash flows \nbeyond 2025, is $37 billion.\nHow can we credibly forecast 10 or more years of cash flows for a company like Amazon.com? We \ncan't.

Assign probabilities to the scenarios and calculate a weighted value of the scenarios. Use the \neconomic rationale and its likelihood to estimate the wei ghts assi gned to each scenario.\nThis approach provides an estimate of the value as well as scenarios that put boundaries on the \nvaluation. Managers can use these boundaries to think about ways to modify their strategy and how \nto res pond to si gnals about which scenario is likel y to come true.\nIs there anything managers can do to reduce or take advantage of the cyclicality of their industry? In \nour experience, managers often miss opportunities and even cause greater cyclicality. For example, \ncyclical companies often commit to major capital spending projects just when prices are high and the cycle is hitting its peak, presumably on the assumption that prices will remain high. Conversely, cyclical companies retrench when prices are low. Sometimes companies develop forecasts similar to the equity analysts, upward sloping regardless of where the company is in the cycle. Managers, who \nhave detailed information about their markets, should be able to do a better job than the financial \nmarket in fi\nguring out the c ycle and take a ppropriate actions.\nOne further consequence of this behavior is that cyclical companies often send the wrong signals to \nthe market. Expanding when prices are high tells the financial market that the future looks great \n(often just before", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2725, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6d4a482-6963-4fdc-870e-5435574ed5e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6d4a482-6963-4fdc-870e-5435574ed5e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "337", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "430d1a00-cbf5-40ed-b811-94a3d89aa4b7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "337", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "f34e6afec45d02b9cc24d9dee6ca4530d04681afdf028e8a9fb932351a46529f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b02f8fcd-d019-4577-8fd3-5af13e8d4ce4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "336", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "3bfe33eba3f303334a95a8c2a7b02005ae7075a573b65a6e6d0807dea03ce3c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4fd8fad5-bdcd-4b1b-9f76-3db2bb0e190b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f528d6688fe852624f93c8d686ad16c405768484ccc92eb067945f8ac8438534", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 334\nExhibit 16.6 Relative Returns from Capital Expenditure Timing\nthe cycle turns down).

The next chapter describes additional accounting issues when dealing \nwith financial statements \nprepared in different countries.\nForeign Currenc y Translation Accountin g\nTo avoid potential distortions caused by foreign currency translation accounting, it is best to conduct the entire analysis and valuation in the currency of the foreign subsidiary. Sometimes, financial statements of the foreign subsidiary have already been converted by the parent company using U.S. accounting standards, and it may (on occasion) be necessary to adjust them back to the foreign currenc\ny to avoid distortin g cash-flow forecasts.\nTo understand the performance of the subsidiary and, if necessary, to reverse-engineer the U.S. \nstatements, you must understand the accounting principles involved. The Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement No. 52 describes the methods for translating foreign currency \ntransactions and statements.\nTransactions in currencies other than the home currency of the subsidiary are translated into the \nhome currency at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. For example, a sale by the English subsidiary in Euros will be recorded by the English subsidiary in pounds at the exchange \nrate on the day of the sale. Similarly, the English subsidiary will record a receivable in pounds for \nthe sale at the same rate. Whenever the English subsidiary prepares financial statements, assets such as receivables in Euros or cash accounts in Euros are presented at the exchange rate for the balance sheet date. Gains or losses on these assets or liabilities flow throu\ngh the income statement.\nTranslation of subsidiaries' financial statements into the currency of its parent is more complex. For \nmoderate inflation economies, the current  method is used. All balance sheet items except equity are \ntranslated at the year-end exchange rate. Translation gains and losses on the balance sheet are carried directly to the equity account and do not affect net income. The average exchange rate for \nthe \nperiod is used for translatin g the income statement.\nFor high inflation economies, the temporal  method is used. Historical exchange rates are applied to \nphysical assets such as property, plant, and equipment and inventories. Year-end rates are applied to \nmonetar y assets and liabilities like cash, receivables, and payables.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2841, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55cac2af-02c6-4f0b-ba1a-3089e3deca13": {"__data__": {"id_": "55cac2af-02c6-4f0b-ba1a-3089e3deca13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "341", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["Exhibit"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46fc56e1-20e7-42ce-819c-73d718148d10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "341", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "0b6f4c2aae3afc4d1351099e47cd1da6fa76e72bb4e21ab6badc0ad079401cf0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4eac250c-ca4a-4cc5-9070-bedf6d9db63c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "340", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "2dd668423f340adedebee0ac24ae95291928a4ba9dfc5da1e732f884c834b69d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca0dd09c-98d7-49f4-949c-32de3d908191", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3f5c5802e902a818559fdb49b1e0200fa9f6cfd25db33cf969853d45d361f5dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 338\nBoth methods are illustrated in the example set out in Exhibit 17.3.

In most cases, it also requires understanding of tax codes (an d their enforcement) in \nevery countr y where the parent com pany and its subsidiaries do business.\nOne technical issue relevant to valuing subsidiaries of multinational companies is the treatment of foreign tax credits.

Whenever foreign tax credits reach the maximum allowable under U.S. law, as in the first \nexample in Exhibit 17.4, consolidated taxes paid equal the total of local taxes, and no corporate tax \npenalty is levied. When tax credits are below the maximum allowable, as in the second example in \nExhibit 17.4, consolidated taxes exceed the total of local taxes, and a U.S. corporate tax penalty is levied. In effect, the U.S. tax code may raise the effective tax rate for subsidiaries located in lower-tax countries.\nFor the second example in Exhibit 17.4, the U.S. tax code has raised the average effective tax rate to \nthe parent company on income in country E from 20 percent to (30 + 80)/400 = 27.5 percent. The marginal effective tax rate on country E income is 34 percent, the U.S. tax rate. The effective tax rate in a foreign country may not be its domestic statutory rate, because, given the specific \ncircumstances, it may depend on the parent company's tax rate. Looking at the second example in \nExhibit 17.4, if this situation were expected to persist, it might be advisable for the parent to sell company E to an owner from country E. The reason is that the after-tax cash flow would be higher from the \nperspective of a countr y E owner.\nThese examples are simplified.

Suppose that the profits reflected in the first example in Exhibit 17.4 are based on market  prices. The economics \ntextbooks usually recommend that, tax considerations aside, all decision making should be based on market prices. In this examp le, however, tax \nconsiderations cannot be ignored.

But first, you should forecast the components of cash flow in their most relevant  currency. \nThis means forecasting the British pound cash flows in British pounds, the Swiss franc cash flows in Swiss francs, and so on, before combining them into a set of financials for the foreign subsidiary. In \npractice, this is an iterative process: you cannot forecast the individual line items without \nconsidering how they affect the other line items in the forecast. You need a coherent integrated forecast that reflects the com\npetitive d ynamics of the business unit.\nOnce all cash flow has been forecasted in terms of its most relevant currency, it should be converted \ninto the currency of the subsidiary before discounting using the forward-rate method. In our \nexample, forward foreign exchange rates are used to convert forecasted French Euro revenues to British pound cash flow on a year-by-year basis. Then it combines this with other pound-equivalent cash flow received by the English subsidiary, and discounts it at the English subsidiary's weighted \naverage cost of capital. As a practical matter, for most currencies forward exchange rates are not \navailable beyond 18 months. Using this method means forecasting long-term foreign exchange rates, a task that will be ex\nplained shortl y.\nA mathematically equivalent alternative to the forward-rate method is the spot-rate method. We will \nemploy it in step 3 to discount all of the subsidiary's cash flow that has been restated in pounds \nsterling at the English subsidiary's cost of capital to translate its present value to U.S. dollars at the s\npot exchan ge rate.\nThe spot-rate method is not generally used to convert partial cash flow, such as a revenue stream \ndenominated in Euros, because no practical way exists to estimate a risk-adjusted Euro discount rate for the revenue stream alone. Estimating the appropriate discount rate for total cash flow from o\nperations is difficult enou gh.\nTo do the forward-rate method, you must use interest-rate parity to forecast future spot foreign \nexchange rates, and then use the future spot foreign exchange rates to convert predicted foreign currenc\ny cash flow into the subsidiar y's domestic currenc y.

The fact that a \nsubsidiary is located in a foreign country does not change the definition of the weighted average cost of capital. The two most  common errors in setting \nthe WACC are making ad hoc adjustments for risk and using the parent country WACC to discount foreign currency cash flow. Regar ding the first \npoint, ad hoc adjustments to the discount rate to reflect political risk, foreign investment risk, or foreign currency risk are  entirely inappropriate. As we \nwill explain in Chapter 19, political risk is best handled by adjusting expected cash flow, weighting it by the probability of various scenarios. Foreign \ncurrency or foreign investment risk is handled by the spot exchange rate, and is perfectly symmetrical. An equal chance of a ga in or a loss of \npurchasing power exists. It should be clear that if cash flow is predicted in units of the foreign currency, it should be disco unted at the foreign country \ndiscount rate because this rate reflects the o pportunit y cost of ca pital in the forei gn countr y, includin g expected inflation and the market risk premium.\nThe target capital structure for a subsidiary is the mix of financing, stated in market values, that it would maintain in the l ong run on a stand-alone \nbasis. The actual capital structure imposed on the subsidiary by its parent may depart widely from the subsidiary's target. For tax reasons, the subsidiary \nmay be loaded up with debt.

Thirty-five percent of the responding companies used derivatives for hedging, and given that they hedg ed, 47 percent used \nover-the-counter forward contracts. The prevalence of transaction hedging is shown in Exhibit 17.11. The common practice is to identify a specific \nsource of risk in a foreign currency, then take an offsetting position in forward contracts or options. The problem with this a pproach is that it does not \ntake all cash flows into account (and may actually unhedge the company). Even if it does consider all cash flows, these cash fl ows, usually payables \nand receivables, cannot be forecasted with a hi gh degree of accurac y.

By substituting the optimal hedge ratio into the variance equation, we see that the standard deviation of the minimum variance hedge portfolio depends on the correlation \nbetween the o peratin g profit and the gains or losses on the forward contracts:\nFor example, the r-squared must be 60 percent in order to reduce the variance of the unhedged \noperating profits by 37 percent. An r-squared of 90 percent will reduce the variance roughly 68 \npercent. This demonstrates that regardless of the optimal hedge ratio, one must have a very high correlation between the operating profits and the forward contracts in order to have an efficient \nhedge. In practice, the inability to accurately forecast receivables and payables makes it difficult to \nhave hi\nghly efficient hed ges.\nEven though your company hedges at the optimal hedge ratio, the cost of hedging may exceed the \nbenefits (Exhibit 17.12). In the exhibit, the firm's operating cash flows are characterized as a random \nwalk (a Gauss Wiener process) through time, starting at level P0, with a positive drift to reflect \nexpected growth. If this line should happen to touch a lower boundary, illustrated by the upward \nsloping straight line starting at h0, the firm experiences business disruption costs such as the loss of \ncustomers and talented management, missed investment opportunities, or even a trip to the \nbankru ptcy courts.\nHedging has two effects on operating cash flows. The desirable effect is to reduce the volatility of \ncash flows. The line representing hedged cash flows has lower volatility. The undesirable effect is that the cost of hedging reduces the slope of the line. Thus, a value-maximizing approach to hedging examines the ex\npected benefit versus the ex pected cost.

Regardless of the accounting system, if you follow the approach in Chapter 9, free cash flow will be the same. When developing cash-flow projections, however, we typically use financial ratios like margin and ROIC as benchmarks for the projections. \nFollowing the approach in Chapter 9, we can eliminate some but not all of the accounting \ndifferences that show u\np in ratios like mar gin and ROIC.\nIn 1996, Hoechst, the German chemicals and life sciences company, translated its 1996 financial \nstatements, prepared under German accounting standards, to U.S. generally accepted accounting \nprinciples (GAAP) to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Under German accounting standards, Hoechst reported net income of DM 2.1 billion. Under U.S. GAAP, Hoechst's net income was only DM 1.1 billion, a difference of DM 1.0 billion (Exhibit 18.2). When both sets of books are translated into NOPLAT, invested capital, and ROIC, the gap is narrowed but not eliminated. Based \non the German books, NOPLAT is DM 2.3 billion, while it is DM 2.0 billion based on the U.S. \nbooks.

In countries where revaluation is \ndone over longer periods, the revaluation reserve should be spread over the period in question. In \nany case, when calculating free cash flow, capital spending should be determined as the increase in net fixed assets plus depreciation, less the increase in the revaluation reserve. Otherwise, investments would be overstated.\nDeferred Taxation\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between a company's published financial statements and its \ntax accounts. In Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, deferred taxes normally do not arise in the \naccounts of individual companies because financial statements are the same as tax accounts. \nHowever, deferred taxes may arise in consolidated accounts. In other countries, deferred taxes could \nbe substantial because of items such as asset revaluation and accelerated de preciation.\nTo calculate NOPLAT, invested capital, and ROIC, income taxes should be stated on a cash basis. \nFor NOPLAT, the increase in deferred taxes (as a balance sheet item) should be subtracted from the amount of taxes on the income statement to calculate taxes on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). For invested capital, deferred taxes should be treated as an equity item as described in Cha\npter 9.\nConsolidation\nAs summarized in Exhibit 18.7, most countries require consolidation of accounts when a subsidiary \nis more than 50 percent owned, or when there is a controlling interest. In some cases, these \nconsolidation principles were adopted only recently; consequently, historical accounts may not be \nentirely comparable.

Th e effects of changing \nthe payout ratio in one model are shown in Exhibit 18.12. Where dividend imputation is not present, dividend policy has no impa ct on value. Where \nimputation is used, all other factors bein g equal, the hi gher the payout ratio, the hi gher the value of the firm.\nCost of Ca pital\nThe basic approach for estimating the weighted average cost of capital is identical to that described in Chapter 10. The weight ed average cost of capital \nfor a company is a weighted average of the costs of its equity, debt, and other financing sources. The cost of capital should b e consistent with and \nexpressed in the same currenc y as the cash flows bein g discounted.\nMost of the components of the cost of capital do not require special discussion here. For example, it is common practice around  the world to use the \nCAPM for estimatin g the cost of e quity. Two issues merit detailed discussion: what market risk premium and beta to use.\nAs in the United States, the choice of market risk premium is vexing. For countries that are developed and reasonably integrate d into the global capital \nmarket, we favor usin g a worldwide risk premium, based on the U.S. risk premium of 4.5 percent to 5 percent.\nOur reasoning is based on the globalization of capital markets. In the late 1990s, about 25 percent of all equity trades were c onsidered international\u2014in \nother words, the shareholder and the company were domiciled in different countries. These global traders, primarily large insti tutional investors, draw \ntheir capital from and invest it all over the world. If expected premiums were significantly different across countries (on a r isk-adjusted basis), you \nwould expect to see significant flows to countries with higher-than-average premiums and away from lower-than-average premiums.

Yet valuation is much more difficult in these environments because the risks and obstacles that companies face are greater than in developed markets. Major risks and challenges include high levels of macroeconomic uncertainty, illiquid capital markets, controls on the flow of capital in and out of the country, and high levels of political \nrisk.\nThere is no agreement on how to address these challenges among academics, investment bankers, \nand industry practitioners. Methods vary considerably and often involve making arbitrary \nadjustments based on limited empirical evidence and gut feel. In the face of this lack of consensus, \nwe recommend a pragmatic approach of comparing estimates of the value from three methods as summarized in Exhibit 19.1. Our primary approach is to use discounted cash flows with probability-weighted scenarios that explicitly model the risks that the business faces. The value obtained from this approach is then compared to a DCF approach with a country-risk premium built into the cost o\nf \ncapital and a valuation based on com parable tradin g multi ples.1\nSpecial thanks to our colleague Mimi James, who co-wrote this chapter.\n1 Note that when using the DCF approach with a country-risk premium built into the discount rate, cash flows \nshould not be reduced by the country risk already in the discount rate.

This creates distortions in net property, plant, and equipment, and invent ories (so-called \nnonmonetary assets) relative to other balance sheet items and the income statement.

When done properly, the resulting value should be identical. (Nominal cash flows discounted at a nominal rate should equal the \ncorresponding real cash flows discounted at the corresponding real rate.) By applying both methods, you know that you have prop erly handled the \neffects of inflation.\nRationale for Valuin g in Both Real and Nominal Terms\nThe major differences and shortcomings of doing a valuation in nominal and real terms are summarized in Exhibit 19.2. In short,  doing the valuation in \nreal terms makes it virtually impossible to calculate taxes correctly (taxes are calculated based on nominal financial statemen ts) and also can lead to \nerrors in the cash-flow effects of working capital changes. The downside of using the nominal cash flows is that ratios, such a s the ROIC and property, \nplant, and equipment to revenues are often meaningless in high inflationary environments. Another downside of the nominal DCF v aluation is that the \ncontinuing value formula needs to incorporate the real growth and expected returns to reflect the true economics of the busines s in the continuing value \nperiod.\nThe example in Exhibit 19.3 illustrates the need for both nominal and real forecasts. This company does not grow in real terms and the annual inflation \nrate is 20 percent. The nominal EBITDA grows with inflation and the unadjusted real-cash flows are flat. In the nominal case, t he depreciation grows \nmuch slower than the EBITDA so that depreciation shelters less and less of the growth of nominal EBITDA from taxes. The working  capital \nrequirements in the nominal case, however, continue to grow with inflation, which erodes the cash-flow value. This effect is no t reflected in the real \ncash flows if looked at from changes in the balance sheet. To be accurate, the real cash flows need to reflect the actual tax s hields and the working \ncapital requirements. These can only be estimated from the nominal accounts and then translated, as in the third example, where  the translations from \nthe nominal accounts are hi ghlighted.

Convert the operating performance into nominal terms. For most items this simply means \nmultiplying the item by the inflation index for the year. Net property, plant, and equipment, depreciation, and inventories should not be adjusted; they are the same in real and nominal financial statements.\n4. Forecast interest expense and other nonoperating income statement items in nominal terms (based \non the \nprior year's balance sheet ).\n5. Calculate income taxes based on the nominal income statement. (This requires some knowledge \nof the local tax laws. )\n6. Complete the balance sheet in nominal terms. First, the equity should equal last year's equity plus earnings less dividends and plus or minus any share issues or repurchases. Then, balance the balance \nsheet with debt or marketable securities.\n7. Complete the income statement and balance sheet in real terms. Convert debt, marketable \nsecurities, interest expense, income taxes, and nonoperating terms using the inflation index. The \nequity account is a plug to balance the balance sheet.

From these \nyou can estimate free cash flows. Calculate the nominal free cash flows first using the same approach as described in Chapter 9. Then convert the nominal cash flows to real cash flows using \nthe inflation index.\nThe last step before discounting the cash flows is to estimate the continuing value. Using real cash \nflows requires no adjustments to the normal value driver formula described in Chapter 12. The nominal approach, however, needs to be adjusted because the nominal returns on capital are not \nmeanin\ngful. Use the followin g formula:\nThe nominal NOPLAT used as a base for the continuing value calculation must be adjusted to \nreflect ongoing profitability, which is why it is multiplied by the ratio of the real NOPLAT margin to nominal NOPLAT margin.\n2 The nominal NOPLAT margin will overstate the true long-term \nprofitability because inflation will cause depreciation to be understated. The real NOPLAT margin \nis a better estimate of long-term profitability and the ability of the company to turn revenues into cash flow. Since the NOPLAT has been adjusted to reflect sustainable profitability, the investment required also needs to reflect real investment. Therefore, real growth and real return rates should be \nused in the calculation of continuin\ng value.\nFinally, you are ready to discount the cash flows to the present. Here the key is the relationship \nbetween the real and nominal cost of capital.

In \naddition, many countries have complicated tax credits and adjustments that make the estimation of cash taxes more difficult tha n in developed markets. \nWhile it is not in the scope of this chapter to detail the effects in each country, we highlight some of the most common issues . One point to note is that \nthe large differences in accounting are frequently eliminated when the income statement and the balance sheet are brought toget her in the cash-flow \ncalculation.\nInflation Accountin g\nA few countries, such as Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela (and formerly Brazil), require inflation accounting, often called monetary corrections . \nMonetary corrections attempt to revalue assets because of the effects of inflation and exchange rate changes.

So if the revenue were booked in July at the July currency, the reported revenues in the annual report will be restated at the year-end purchasing \npower. Otherwise, in high-inflation environments, the income statement items would not really be \nadditive since they would be based on different purchasing power. The balance sheet only has adjustments to fixed assets, inventory, and equity; the accounts payable and receivable are already in year-end terms. As in inflation accounting valuations, revaluations of property, plant, and e\nquipment need to be backed out of ca pital s pendin g calculations.\nEstimatin g Cash Taxes\nIn emerging markets, an accurate assessment of cash taxes can be quite challenging. An example is \nBrazil, which has had large and frequent changes to the tax code. In 1996, Brazil eliminated \ninflation accounting and reduced the corporate tax rate to 30.5 percent. In 1997, the government disallowed the deductibility of the social contribution tax, effectively increasing the tax rate to 33 percent. To make up for the loss of the tax shields that inflation accounting had generated, the government allowed companies to deduct interest on equity net of a withholding tax of 15 percent. \nMany other emerging markets have significant cash tax adjustments that need to be understood \nbefore you start a valuation.\nDealin g with Exchan ge Rates and Inflation Rate Ga ps\nIn many emerging market companies, the individual components of the cash flows are not \ndenominated in the same currency. A substantial portion of a company's revenues and debt may be \ndenominated in dollars, for example, while its expenses are primarily local. Consider an oil exporter. Its revenues are determined by the dollar price of oil while many of its costs (labor and local purchases) are determined by the local currency. Unless foreign exchange rates immediately \nadjust to inflation differentials (in other words, purchasing power parity holds), the company's \no\nperatin g margins and cash flows will deviate from their lon g-term trend.\nIt is important to keep two facts in mind when estimating the impact of changing exchange rates. \nFirst, over the long run, purchasing power does hold. In other words, exchange rates ultimately do \nadjust for differences in inflation between countries. Second, exchange rates can deviate from \npurchasing power parity by up to 20 to 25 percent for as long as ten or more years (although \npurchasin g power parity adjusted exchan ge rates are enormousl y difficult to estimate ).\n3 Some companies will report in U.S. dollars to avoid this problem.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2866, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f28f2b4b-ba87-4fad-834c-0e8eb274b992": {"__data__": {"id_": "f28f2b4b-ba87-4fad-834c-0e8eb274b992", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "382", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19", "entities": ["U.S .", "Brazil"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f586ebe3-8f64-4a1b-b8ab-da548f1b5f68", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "382", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "c2f816e5ef038d1ef211cf28a7704e934f73d23fc21e6a5dd1a3d285c5401aeb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe54e83a-0e68-4ae4-99ed-58294a2313de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "381", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "2ef1b4e25f103618d6a9fa448c679f222d3ac3ce090a87dd47645db8388e260d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "891163de-ffea-4f8d-8407-a2ba739161b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "405a1e0eff6c27c53fa9d377d61d72092f4b4096bf5264975aea54f1a3961495", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 381\nExhibit 19.5 Brazilian PPP Adjusted Exchange Rates\nFor example, if you held $100 million of Brazilian currency in 1960, by 1998 it would have been worth less than one cent in U.S . dollars.

Emerging \nmarket risks to consider include inflation, macroeconomic volatility, capital controls, political risk, \nwar or civil disturbances, regulatory changes, poorly defined or enforced contract or investor rights, and corru\nption.\nPros and Cons o f Where to Incor porate Countr y Risks\nThere are many opinions on how to incorporate these additional risks in a DCF valuation, and \nwhether to include them in the cash flows (the numerator) or the discount rate (the denominator). Accounting for these risks in the cash flows through probability-weighted scenarios provides a more \nsolid analytical foundation and a more robust understanding of the value than incorporating them in \nthe discount rate.\nFour practical arguments support this view. First, most country risks such as expropriation, \ndevaluation, and war are largely diversifiable (though not entirely, as the economic crisis in 1998 \ndemonstrated). Finance theory clearly indicates that the cost of capital should reflect only nondiversifiable risk. Diversifiable risk is better handled in the cash flows. Nonetheless, a recent survey showed that managers generally add some risk premium to the discount rate to adjust for these risks.\n4 However, more and more com panies are buildin g the risks into the cash flows.\nSecond, many country risks don't apply equally to all companies in a given country. For example, \nbanks are more likely to be nationalized than retailers; or some companies may benefit from a devaluation (raw materials exporters) while others will be damaged (raw materials importers). Applying the same risk premium to all companies in the country would overstate the risk for some \nand understate it for others.\nThird, country risks tend to be one-sided (only down). It is much easier to build one-sided risks into \ncash-flow scenarios than discount rates. Most attempts to build risk into the discount rate are ad hoc \nor based not on equity risk but the credit risk of the country. A common approach is to add a \ncountry-risk premium equal to the difference between the interest rate on a local bond denominated in U.S. dollars and a U.S. government bond of similar maturity. In many situations, equity investments in a company in the country will actually be less risky than investing in government bonds. For example, the bonds of YPF (the Argentine oil company) carry lower yields than \nArgentine government debt. In addition, equity investments carry potential upside risks, while bonds \ncarr\ny only downside risks.\n4 T. Keck, E. Levengood, and A.

When \nyou construct a hi gh-inflation scenario, forei gn exchan ge rates should reflect this inflation in the lon g run because of purchasin g power parity.\nNext, determine how each of the components of the cash flow is driven by changes in the macroeconomic variables. Link these item s to the \nmacroeconomic variables, so that when the macroeconomic scenario is chan ged the cash-flow items ad just automaticall y.\nAfter the macroeconomic variables are linked, think about industry scenarios. Constructing industry scenarios is basically the same in emerging \nmarkets as in developed markets, with a few variations. One difference is that industries in emerging markets may be more drive n by government \nactions.

Revenues and mar gins are quite robust in this scenario.\nThe second scenario assumes that the Brazilian econom y remains in recession for two years with hi gh interest rates and low GDP growth and inflation.\nThe third scenario assumes a dramatic devaluation (which is what did happen) with inflation rising to 30 percent and the econom y shrinking by 5 \npercent.

Many local markets are not integrated with the \nglobal market and frequently there are restraints on the ability of local investors to invest outside their home market. As a result, the cost of capital to a local investor could be considerably different than a global investor. Further, there is not a common framework for estimating the capital cost for local investors.\nWe assume that the global economy will become fully integrated and that most emerging markets \nwill become open and efficient. This assumption allows application of the CAPM to estimate the cost of equity in emerging markets. We recognize that the degree of integration of emerging markets \nwith developed markets varies significantly and the CAPM is a less robust model for the less-\nintegrated emerging markets. We expect, however, that it will become a better predictor of required equity returns worldwide. We assume that countries with capital controls that restrict local investors' access to a global risk-free rate will eliminate these restrictions in the long run. Since we value cash flows to infinity and assume that it will be a matter of years for most emerging markets to integrate, \nwe believe it is warranted to apply CAPM with minimal adjustments to estimate cost of equity in \nemer\nging markets.\nA complementary assumption is that most country risks are diversifiable, from the perspective of the \nglobal investor. As a result, many of the additional risks encountered in emerging markets should be \naccounted for in the cash flows rather than the discount rate as discussed in the previous section of \nthis cha pter.\nGiven these assumptions, the cost of capital in emerging markets should generally be close to a \nglobal cost of capital adjusted for local inflation and capital structure. Before going on to the \nmethodology itself, we present some overall advice on estimating the cost of capital in emerging markets.\nNo One ''Ri\nght\" Answer\u2014Be Pra gmatic\nSome ways of estimating the cost of capital in emerging markets, are better than others, but there is \nroom for debate.

There are three main proble ms in determining an \nappropriate local risk-free rate in emerging markets: Most of the government debt in emerging markets is not, in fact, risk fre e. The ratings on much of \nthis debt are often well below investment grade. It is difficult to find debt longer than three years in many emerging markets.  Finally, the long-term \ndebt that does exist is usuall y in U.S. dollars, a Euro pean currenc y, or Ja panese yen and so is not a ppropriate to discount local nominal cash flows.\nTo overcome these obstacles, we recommend a building block approach.

The sovereign-risk premium needs to be subtracted because it reflects credit risk and \nother items that are not part of a risk-free rate. The final step is to adjust the bond so that it is \nequivalent to a 10-year bond. Usually you can extend the duration by compounding the inflation.

You can also compound \nthe inflation difference between the countries and add it as a single number to calculate a single cost \nof capital for all periods. The level of inflation difference dictates the choice of methods. If it is \nhigh, an annual estimate of the cost of ca pital is preferable.\nMethod three is the simplest and is available as an option in all countries. It starts with the 10-year \nU.S. government yield and adds an inflation differential between the U.S. and the local rate to \ndevelo p a local nominal ris k-free rate.\nThe key assumption in the calculation of the risk-free rate is that most investors, including investors \nin local markets, have access to an international risk-free rate. In countries such as India or China, \nhowever, local investors do not have access to a global risk-free rate. The most risk-free instrument \navailable to them is the local government debt, which has sovereign risk embedded in the yield. This difference in access to a risk-free rate means that foreign investors will have a lower cost of capital than local investors, at least in the short run. As capital controls ease, this difference should \ndisa\nppear. Determinin g the timin g of this is sub jective and should be included as part of a scenario.\nCountr y-Risk Premium\nIn the previous discussion, we laid out a rationale for excluding country risk. If you do wish to \ninclude a country-risk premium, start with the sovereign risk. The sovereign risk can be calculated \nby subtracting the 10-year U.S. government bond yield from a U.S. dollar-denominated local bond's stripped yield. If there is no U.S. dollar-denominated bond, subtract the inflation differential between the local country and the United States first to calculate the country sovereign-risk \npremium.\nThe next step is more controversial\u2014subtracting the credit risk embedded in the yield. This is an \nattempt to estimate the cost of equity. Again, we do not believe that it is appropriate to include the risk of default and credit deterioration that make up the credit risk of a bond in the cost of equity \ncalculation. The market-risk premium for equity already includes the possibility of losing your \ninvestment and so to include that risk a\ngain re presents double countin g.\nSo how do we eliminate the credit risk? There is no exact way to determine what part of the \ncountry-risk premium is associated with credit risk, so we approximate. Assume that since the bond-\nrating companies have standard criteria for rating bonds worldwide, the premium on bonds with a \nparticular rating is similar across all bonds. The premium associated with a particular rating is readily available for U.S. corporate bonds from the bond rating agencies.

The question becomes which country-risk premium to use, the current market estimate or a lon g-run estimate?

Adding known components, the risk-free rate, \nthe rating premium, and the inflation differential, you can assemble the cost of debt. For global \ninvestors, it is important to keep in mind that country risk can be diversified away in a bond portfolio, so no country-risk premium should be included. Coca-Cola and Colgate Palmolive, for example, have costs of debt no higher than their U.S.-focused competitors, even though much of \ntheir profits and investments are in emerging markets.

Assume that the rating for most global steel companies is BB+ but the capital structure for the local company is more heavily debt laden than the global capital structure, implying that its rating might be BB.

In cases such as these, you may want to consider estimating the tax shields on debt directly as the cost of financing gradually declines to reflect the true cost of \ndebt. The cash flows would be discounted at an unlevered cost of equity and the net present value of \nthe tax shields would be added to the cash-flow value.\nThe marginal tax rate in emerging markets can be very different from the effective tax rate, which \nmay include investment tax credits, export tax credits, taxes, equity or dividend credits, and \noperating loss credits. Many of these do not provide a tax shield on interest expense. Only taxes that apply to interest expense should be used in the discount rate. Other taxes or credits should be modeled directl\ny in the cash flows.\nIn emerging markets, many companies have an unusual capital structure for their industry. \nAnomalies in the local debt or equity markets often cause the difference.

The DCF \nmethod was originally applied to project evaluation and later extended to whole companies. Over \nthe past decade or so, theoretical and computational advances have allowed finance practitioners to adapt financial option pricing techniques to the valuation of investment decisions, so-called real options. Option pricing methods are superior to traditional DCF approaches because they explicitly capture the value of flexibility. As a result, we believe that option-\npricing techniques will eventually \nreplace traditional DCF methods for investment decisions where there is significant future \nflexibility. It is not clear that option pricing will replace DCF techniques for valuing whole companies except in limited circumstances. It may be that the bundles of assets and opportunities that com\npanies own cannot be practicall y valued as o ptions\u2014at least not yet.\nTo review, the traditional NPV approach for valuing a project assumes the project has an expected \nlife, say 10 years, and that its expected free cash flows should be discounted at a risk-adjusted rate called the cost of capital. From the resulting present value, we subtract the initial investment outlay. The result is a net present value that must be positive to accept the project.

The right to take an action is flexibility. The necessity of taking an action is inflexibility. \nCall options give the right to buy, and put options the right to sell. Options can be found on both the assets and the liabilities sides of the balance sheet.\nExamples of options on the assets side of the balance sheet are primarily related to flexibility. A \ncompany that has the option to shut down and restart operations, defer their start, expand, contract, or abandon them, is more flexible and therefore more valuable than the same company without these options. Asset options are important not only because they affect the values of companies that have them but also because they provide explicit criteria for deciding when operations should be opened, \nclosed, or abandoned. An option to open and close a mining operation may add 30 percent to 40 \npercent to its present value based on expected cash flow. The option provides explicit decision rules; \nfor exam ple, \"o pen the mine when the price of Kr yptonite exceeds $100 per ounce.\"\nOptions on the liabilities side of the balance sheet are easy to recognize.

Notice that the NPV is the same because the expected cash flows remain unchanged and we also assume that the new risk is uncorrelated \nwith the economy, so the capital asset pricing model beta and the cost of capital are unchanged.

As with financial options, the value of a real option depends on five parameters: the market value of the underlying asset on which the option is contingent; the exercise price of the option; the time remaining until the maturity of the option; the volatility of the \nunderlying asset, and the risk-free rate of interest. These are all clearly defined for financial options, \nbut require better understanding for real options. A sixth parameter is the amount of dividends paid \nby the underl ying risky asset. We shall come back to it a little later.\nThe parameters that affect the value of a real option are summarized in Exhibit 20.2. Note that an \nimportant difference between financial and real options is that management can affect the value of the underlying risky asset (a physical project under its control) while financial options are side bets owned b\ny third parties that cannot affect the outcome of the underl ying asset (e.g., a share of IBM ).\nWithout training, executives often fail to recognize real options and how valuable they can be.

Then, the expected liquidation (or \nresale) value of the project may be thought of as the exercise price of the put. When the present \nvalue of the asset falls below the liquidation value, the act of abandoning (or selling) the project is equivalent to exercising the put. Because the liquidation value of the project sets a lower bound on the value of the project, the option to liquidate is valuable. A project that can be liquidated is worth \nmore than the same \nproject without the possibilit y of abandonment.\nOption to defer development.  The option to defer an investment to develop a property is formally \nequivalent to an American call option on the stock. The owner of a lease on an undeveloped oil reserve has the right to acquire a developed reserve by paying a lease-on-development cost. The \nowner can defer the development process until oil prices rise. In other words, the managerial option \nimplicit in holding an undeveloped reserve is a deferral option. The expected development cost may be thought of as the exercise price of the call. The net production revenue less depletion of the developed reserve is the opportunity cost incurred by deferring the investment. If this opportunity \ncost is too high, the decision maker may want to exercise the option (that is, develop the reserve) \nbefore its relin quishment date.\nOption to expand or contract.  The option to expand the scale of a project is formally equivalent to \nan American call option on the stock. Management may choose to build capacity in excess of the \nexpected level of output so that it can manufacture at a higher rate if the product is more successful \nthan was anticipated. The expansion option gives management the right, but not the obligation, to make additional follow-on investment (for example, to increase the production rate) if project conditions turn out to be favorable. The option to contract the scale of a project's operation is \nformally equivalent to an American put option on stock. Many projects can be engineered so that \noutput can be contracted. Foregoing future spending on the project is equivalent to the exercise price of the \nput.\nOption to extend or shorten.  It is possible to extend the life of an asset or a contract by paying a \nfixed amount of money\u2014an exercise price. Conversely, it is possible to shorten the life of an asset \nor a contract. The option to extend is a call, and the option to shorten is a put.

Buying the option to have greater \nscope is a call.\nSwitching options.  The option to switch project operations is a portfolio of options that consists of \nboth calls and puts. Restarting operations when a project is shut down is equivalent to an American call option. Shutting down operations when unfavorable conditions arise is equivalent to an \nAmerican put option. The cost of restarting (or shutting down) operations may be thought of as the \nexercise price of the call (or put). A project whose operation can be turned on and off (or switched between two distinct locations, and so on) is worth more than the same project without the flexibility to switch. A flexible manufacturing system with the ability to produce two products is a good example of this type of option, as is peak-load power generation and the ability to exit and \nreenter an industr\ny.\nCompound options.  These are options on options. Phased investments are a good example. You \nmay have a factory that can be built as a sequence of real options, each contingent on those that \nprecede it. The project can be continued at each stage by investing a new amount of money (an \nexercise price). Alternatively, it might be abandoned for whatever it can fetch. Other examples are research and development programs, new product launches, exploration and development of oil and gas fields, and an acquisition program where the first investment is thought of as a platform for later ac\nquisitions.\nRainbow options.  Multiple sources of uncertainty produce a rainbow option. Most research and \ndevelopment programs have at least two sources of uncertainty\u2014technological and product-market uncertainty. The latter is represented by the evolution of the uncertain price of the product from a value that is relatively well known today, to less certain values that are affected by the state of the \neconomy as well as other uncertain influences in the future. Thus, product- market uncertainty \nincreases through time. Technological uncertainty, on the other hand, is reduced over time by conducting research until we learn what the product is and what its capabilities are. A similar type of rainbow o\nption is ex ploration and develo pment of natural resources like oil reserves.\nCom paring Approaches\nIn this section, we compare three decision methodologies: net present value (NPV), decision tree \nanalysis (DTA), and option pricing methods. We also introduce the fundamental concept behind option pricing.

Note that these rates are all greater than the 8 percent ris k-free rate.\nWhenever the enterprise approach for valuing a company is used, the market value of equity is \nestimated by first valuing the whole company, the enterprise, and then subtracting the market value of debt to estimate the value of equity. Having a good estimate of the market value of convertible \nsecurities is often crucial. In the example, the value of the company, $400,000, less the market value \nof callable, convertible debt, $115,261, is equal to the value of equity, namely $284,739. Had we used the face value of the debt, $100,000, we would have overestimated the equity value by 5.4 \npercent.\nThe Cost o f Capital for Callable, Convertible Securities\nProfessor Eugene Brigham once surveyed the chief financial officers of 22 companies that had \nissued convertible debt. Of those surveyed, 68 percent said they had used convertible debt because \nthey believed their stock price would rise and that convertibles would provide a way of selling \ncommon stock at a price above the existing market. Another 27 percent said that their company had wanted straight debt but had found conditions to be such that a straight bond issue could not be sold at a reasonable rate of interest.\nNeither reason makes sense. Convertible bonds are not cheap debt. Because convertible bonds are \nriskier, their true cost of capital is greater (on a before-tax basis) than the cost of straight debt. Also, convertible bonds are not equal to deferred sale of common stock at an attractive price. The uncertain sale of shares at $28, each at some unknown future date, can hardly be compared directly with a current share \nprice of $25.\nThe risk of convertible debt is higher than that of straight debt and lower than that of equity, so its \ntrue opportunity cost lies between these limits. The yield to maturity on convertible debt (often lower than on the company's senior debt) has nothing to do with its opportunity cost, because \nconvertible debt has an option embedded in it, and options are much riskier than debt. Going back to \nour numerical example, if we naively estimate the cost of capital on the callable, convertible bond by using the observed price of the bond, $1,152.61, to calculate a yield to maturity, we come up with an estimate of 2.13 \npercent:\nThis is obviously wrong because it is less than the risk-free rate of 8 percent. If we use the true risk-adjusted rates in Exhibit 20.18 the implied geometric average required rate of return on the callable, \nconvertible fond is 14.74 \npercent pretax.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2701, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dc2bb94-4a5c-4419-9c91-937d1a2149a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dc2bb94-4a5c-4419-9c91-937d1a2149a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "424", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3372974d-eda3-48ce-a1f5-710f1a2f304e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "424", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "4ee340ccd5f630e179c877a7408f5b7a9226acfaf88f99d638af8bb3141839c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e16783ec-613a-4428-b5f9-792e9720a877", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "423", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "19bfc0087024a0eeae8b6ecefa3d9dd3a5268bf8de090f69868661a6f942737d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7070432c-de3e-442f-970b-851e464ee174", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0f5755d134eaf0f0beefd581309597caaa5f31e387b07d4731cc9295d0e65b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 424\nThree broad cate gories of information are needed to value a callable, convertible bond and to determine its cost of ca pital:\n1.

It is critical to establish the correct transfer price in order to determine  where the bank should allocate \nits mar ginal resources\u2014to the retail bank or to the wholesale bank.\nThis chapter does not present all the answers to bank valuation, but focuses mainly on the issue of how to value banks. First, we discuss the practical \nreasons why it is easier to use an equity approach than an enterprise approach to valuing banks. Second, we cover the issues in volved in an outsider's \napproach. Finall y, we turn to the problems of an insider's a pproach.\nThe E quity Approach to Valuin g Banks\nThroughout the book we have recommended and used the enterprise DCF approach to valuing companies. (The enterprise approach dis counts the after-\ntax free cash flow from operations at the weighted average cost of capital to first obtain the estimated enterprise value, then  subtracts the market value \nof debt to estimate the equity value.) Although the equity and enterprise approaches are mathematically equivalent, the equity approach to valuing \nbanks is easier to use and reflects the fact that banks can create value from the liability side of the balance sheet. So, we r ecommend that for banks you \nforecast free cash flow to e quity holders and discount it at the cost of e quity.\nThe enterprise method is more difficult to use for banks because a main source of financing is non-interest- bearing customer deposits raised through the \nretail bank, not borrowin g in ca pital markets.

Furthermore, the retail bank is legitimately a separate \nbusiness in its own right, unlike the treasury function of most corporations. These facts make it \ndifficult, if not impossible, to value the bank's equity by first valuing its assets (that is, its lending \nfunction) by discounting interest income less administrative expenses at the weighted average cost of capital, then subtracting the present value of its deposit business (interest expenses plus consumer bank administrative costs, discounted at the cost of debt). Still another problem with the enterprise \napproach for banks is that the spread between the interest received on loans and the cost of capital is \nso low that small errors in estimating the cost of capital can result in huge swings in the value of the \nbank.\nIn addition to being easier to use, there is a conceptual reason for using the equity approach for \nvaluing banks. The deposit franchise given by the government to the bank potentially allows the \nbank to create value on the liabilities side of its balance sheet. If the cost of issuing deposits (e.g., interest expense, check clearing, and tellers) is less than the cost of raising an equivalent amount of funds with equal risk in the open market, then a positive spread is created that creates value for \nshareholders. Thus, liabilities management is part of the business operations of the bank and is not \npurely financing. If it were pure financing, there would be no spread. The bank would be paying market rates for funds received and no value would be created for shareholders (aside from the tax shield of interest ex\npense).\nTo apply the equity DCF method to banks, you need to know how to define free cash flow to \nshareholders and how to use the ''s pread\" or the \"income\" model.\nDefining Free Cash Flow to Shareholders\nFree cash flow to shareholders is net income plus noncash charges less cash flow needed to grow the \nbalance sheet. The value of equity is not simply net income discounted at the cost of equity, because \nnot all of net income can be paid to shareholders. Onl y dividends can be paid to shareholders.\nExhibit 21.2 shows the definition of free cash flow to shareholders of a bank. The best way to think \nabout it is to keep your eye on actual cash in and cash out. Cash flow from the income statement is reasonably straightforward except for the fact that depreciation and provisions for credit losses are not cash flow. Their only effect is to reduce taxes. We find it easier to treat loan-loss provisions as though they are an actual cash flow. We have little choice in the matter because actual cash flows \nregarding the nonpayment of loans are not a matter of public record. Balance sheet cash flow starts \nwith cash in as loans are repaid. Actual cash received is gross loans due less provisions (and unearned income) resulting in net loans paid. To this number we must add increases in deposits and external debt, and sale of new equity, all sources of funds. On the uses side, new loans, increases in \ncash reserves, and securities held re\npresent the main cash outflows.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 3155, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f05af735-58e5-4f73-b763-e8de2c54a105": {"__data__": {"id_": "f05af735-58e5-4f73-b763-e8de2c54a105", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "429", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b5e92d9-174a-4481-86c5-514f2f3b67a3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "429", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "50909e22f20231f01f7164a933d6ad6873a4c1629931f37eabdd357b6130e4a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba2e7e09-251e-46d8-b20a-f13785614f9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "428", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "f5d81919e59188b74e3957e7b2a62ae0d5b8578fdbfa42ba38b575e9f8ef5687", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c5e2fe89-f090-4a47-aa15-40cc5554b924", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "271938fc3ec2d42ac175a4fe6cd0fffcec186b16b54146f066a46b7a317ab1cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 430\nExhibit 21.2 Free Cash Flow to Bank Shareholders \nWhen cash from operations is combined with sources and uses from the balance sheet, the result is free cash flow to shareholder s, which is \nmathematically identical to dividends that could  be paid to shareholders.

We \nassume that loans earn 12 percent, cash reserves at the Federal Reserve Bank earn nothing, deposits pay 5 percent, and the tax rate is 40 percent. Note \nthat the income model, based on the financial statements, com putes net income as $8.\nThe spread model is an alternative but equivalent approach for computing net income. It starts with the assumption that an oppo rtunity cost of money \n(call it the money rate) is charged to the wholesale bank and credited to deposits. In our example, it is 8 percent. The spread  model calculates net \nincome by adding spreads times balances. It then adds a credit for the equity component of the bank's financing, since the spre ads used assume that \ninvestments are 100 percent from borrowings.

The difference  between the DCF \nestimate and the market value of common is roughly 12 percent. The cost of equity, 12.8 percent, uses a beta of 1.29, an assume d market-risk premium \nof 5.4 percent, and a 10- year U.S. Treasur y bond rate of 5.8 percent. A perpetuity model was used to estimate the continuin g value.\nExhibits 21.8, 21.9, and 21.10 show the income statement, the balance sheet, and free cash flow statement, respectively. Exhibi t 21.10 also shows a \nstatement of retained earnings, a part of the model that requires more discussion. The discounted cash flow value of equity is the present value of cash \nflow to equity holders. Normally, one would say that dividends are the same thing as free cash flow, but caution is required. F ree cash flow is the cash \nthat could  be paid as dividends in a given year, not the actual dividends that are paid. The difference between the two is primarily a ma tter of timing. To \nbuild a s preadsheet, one must decide what to do with the cash difference between actual and potential dividends.\nThere are two ways of handling the problem. One way is to carry surplus cash as ''excess marketable securities\" and deficits as  \"unscheduled debt.\" \nUnder this approach, you must discount actual dividends, not potential dividends, or you will double count earnings on the surp lus cash. There is no \neffect on the value of the company because investments in marketable securities have zero net present value. The other approach  is to assume that free \ncash flow in excess of actual dividends is also disbursed to shareholders. This approach helps keep calculation of key ratios, such as equity as a percent \nof total assets, as simple as possible You will see that the statement of retained earnings in Exhibit 21.10 starts with the be ginning retained earnings, \nadds net income, subtracts total dividends actually paid, and then subtracts a line called potential dividends to arrive at the  end-of-period retained \nearnings. This process allows us to keep the ratio of equity to total assets at the guideline set by the Bank for International  Settlements, and helps to \nkeep the financial statements reasonable to a line mana ger.\nNote that dividend policy has no effect on the com pany's value in our model.

Even if actual dividends paid exceed net income, the \nadjustments line will change sign and the effect will be equivalent to borrowing unscheduled debt. \nEither way there is no effect on equity free cash flow because it is the sum of actual dividends and \npotential dividends.\nValuin g Banks from the Inside\nThe main objective of an insider's valuation is to value the bank's business units and to use the \nresults for restructuring or value-based management. Even with complete information, this is a difficult problem because of transfer pricing and shared costs. We will discuss valuation from the inside b\ny focusin g on issues concernin g the retail bank, the wholesale bank, and the treasur y.\nThe Retail Ban k\nMost retail banks are in the business of collecting deposits: non-interest-bearing demand deposits; \ninterest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. For each dollar in deposits, there might be 20 cents in external consumer loans, and the remaining 80 cents is \nlent to the treasury at a transfer price we call the money rate. The first of several issues central to \nvaluing the retail bank is the correct money rate to use. Next is the value of deposit stability. Conce\nptual issues concernin g capital structure and the cost of e quity are also im portant.\nThe Mone y Rate for the Retail Ban k\nThe usual economic principle for transfer pricing is to use the market price. But what is the correct \nopportunity cost for deposits? Logically, it should be the market rate for securities that have the same duration\u2014that is, the same sensitivity of market value to changes in interest rates. \nDetermining the duration of demand deposits and deciding how to match-fund them is tricky. First, \nmost banks confuse the length of time a dollar stays in a demand deposit (that is, its maturity) with the sensitivity of balance values to changes in interest rates (that is, their duration). There is a propensity to choose a money rate that eliminates fluctuations in net interest income rather than to \nchoose a rate that stabilizes shareholder value.

The logic for a credit is that depositors understand and value the FDIC insurance attached to demand deposits. When banks get into trouble (for example, when their credit rating is downgraded), customers usually do not withdraw their deposits and place them in safer \ninstitutions. As a result, federally insured deposits tend to be stable. Troubled institutions that have \nfewer insured deposits have to pay higher yields to obtain short-term funding. For example, the Bank of America, with its large deposit base, was able to retain its FDIC-insured deposits during troubled times. But Continental Illinois, without a large deposit base, had to pay relatively higher \nyields to kee p itself funded durin g a time of crisis.\nThe benefit of FDIC insurance to a retail bank is directly related to the lower cost of funds that \nbanks have to pay, compared with nonbank institutions, for similar duration liabilities. The lower the credit rating of the bank, the higher the benefit of FDIC insurance to it. The cost of FDIC \ninsurance is deducted directly from the cash flow of the retail bank. The value of FDIC insurance is \nthe difference between the indirect benefit and the direct cost.\nFDIC insurance is a put option. In the event of bank default, insured depositors receive the face \nvalue of their deposits (up to $100,000) rather than the fraction of the face value they might \notherwise receive following bankruptcy or reorganization. The maturity date of the FDIC put option \nis the interval until completion of the next audit of the bank's assets. Since the FDIC charges a uniform fee, riskier banks receive a subsid\ny. The value of the subsid y depends primaril y on:\n\u007f The market value of the bank's assets.\n\u007f The variabilit y of the market value of the bank's assets.\n\u007f The total debt of the bank.\n\u007f The proportion of total debt re presented b y insured de posits.\nAlthough the procedure is somewhat crude, it is possible to obtain cross-sectional estimates of the \nper-dollar value of the deposit insurance premium by using a put-option-pricing model. Exhibit \n21.12 shows some estimates obtained for a cross-section of banks in 1983.2 (As you will see, many \nhave since disappeared through mergers and acquisitions, but the example remains valid.)

If we adopt the former approach, then equity is a \npercentage of a major intercompany account, namely loans to the treasury. This philosophy \noverallocates equity because the total equity of all business units will exceed total equity in the bank. To avoid this aggregation problem, it is better to allocate equity to external assets only. Given the numbers in Exhibit 21.13 and assuming that book equity must be 5 percent of external assets, \ne\nquity in the retail bank would be $19 million and loans to the treasur y would be $1.439 billion.\nThe Cost of E quity\nAs always, the cost of equity is the rate of return investors would require for other investments of \nequivalent risk. Preliminary thinking would indicate that no good market comparable exists for the \nretail banking unit as we have structured it because no stand-alone banks exist with 80 percent of their assets invested in ''loans to treasury\" (or in government securities that return the money rate, the bank's transfer price). We have deliberately chosen the money rate to immunize the value of \nshareholders' equity against changes in market rates of interest. Even though in our allocation \nscheme the book equity of the retail banking unit is only about 1 percent of total assets, it has little interest-rate risk. Reserves serve as a buffer to protect against account withdrawals and loan defaults.\nThe major risk borne by equity in the retail bank is the portion of loan default risk correlated with \nthe economy, a risk that affects only the external assets of the retail bank. Since equity is roughly 5 percent of external assets (that is, the amount required by regulation in our hypothetical example), equity risk will be roughly the same as for comparable retail banks that have a low ratio of loans to de\nposits.\nThe Wholesale Ban k\nThe primary business activity of the wholesale bank is making loans. For each dollar of loans, there \nmight be only 20 cents in deposits; therefore, the wholesale bank funds itself by borrowing from the \nbank's treasury. The critical issue is how to determine the correct transfer price or money rate the wholesale bank must pay for the funds it uses. Once this issue has been resolved, we can turn to ca\npital structure and the cost of e quity.\nThe Mone y Rate for the Wholesale Ban k\nThe opportunity cost of funds for a loan portfolio depends on those factors that affect its systematic \nrisk: duration, the sensitivity of its value to changes in interest rates, and the portion of its credit or \ndefault risk that cannot be diversified away.

We recommend that book equity in the wholesale bank be \ndetermined as a percenta ge of its external assets (usuall y equal to total assets ).\nCost of E quity\nThe cost of equity for the wholesale bank will be less than for the bank as a whole because each \nloan portfolio is match-funded with a money rate that accounts for both credit risk and interest-rate (duration) risk and the ratio of equity to total assets will be close to the regulatory requirement. Business risk is the primary risk left in the wholesale bank after match-funding. Hence, its cost of \ne\nquity will be close to the unlevered cost of ca pital for the entire bank.\nTreasur y and Head quarters\nThe bank treasury borrows from the retail bank and lends to the wholesale bank. It also handles the \nbank's trading business and is responsible for centralized risk management. To organize our \ndiscussion of these issues, we cover, in turn, the mismatch problem, centralized risk management, the cost of equity, and the shared-cost problem. We will not discuss the treasury's capital structure except to say that, as before, equity will be allocated to the treasury based on the amount of external assets it holds.\nMismatch Profits and Losses\nThe philosophy that we have adopted is to match-fund the retail and wholesale banks as closely as \npossible for credit and interest-rate (duration) risk. The business reason for doing so is to provide \nbusiness-unit managers with guidelines that lead directly to positive net present value decisions. For example, a loan officer must earn an all-in rate (fees plus interest) that exceeds a money rate that is adjusted for credit and duration risk. To the extent that the risk and duration of deposits is less than for loans, the treasury unit will record a mismatch profit. We have already illustrated, in Exhibit \n21.6 and the accompanying discussion, that mismatch profits can be illusory. Recall that the key to \nhandling mismatch gains or losses is to build a good cash flow forecast that takes into account the way spreads are forecasted to evolve with changing interest-rate environments; the inflow of funds from loans being paid off and the outflow of funds at new rates as new loans are made; the \nsubstitution between interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits as interest-rate environments \nchange, and the portion of mismatch profits that are sustainable because forward rates tend to be hi\ngher than their corres pondin g realized rates.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2758, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3797ded-fd0b-4c9d-adfd-992b66e208e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3797ded-fd0b-4c9d-adfd-992b66e208e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "445", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24cd907f-a684-4d95-bbbf-7bcde4f0f710", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "445", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "08601681a987392f649b4d6ad886ff343dd615b1f4cc36114c6c86ebc6d669dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2dd01a30-9e6b-4a79-9188-c1f3fee7e962", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "444", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/Valuation/Valuation.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 16904771, "creation_date": "2024-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-19"}, "hash": "dd5db8edbb769a80126b4f0457ca14baf2356aa471ce522495815811d21fd46e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33f63d75-f093-49c6-bd8b-0a2ec743aa90", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b06ff17977eef00c5e6998440244eac8fcbb5d289aa682db3ae7237c2db82bc5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Page 446\nCentralized Risk Mana gement\nAlthough current mismatch profits or losses may be illusory, the fact that they fluctuate with \nunexpected changes in the term structure of interest rates means that mismatch creates risk for shareholders. Financial futures positions can be used to offset this mismatch risk. A bank that lends long term and borrows short term can hedge against the risk of an increase in interest rates by taking \nan offsetting short position in financial futures. This form of risk management is best implemented \nby the treasur y unit, which has a centralized point of view.\nThe Cost of E quity\nThe recommended transfer-pricing mechanism collects interest-rate risks in the treasury unit. If the \ntreasury does nothing to hedge these risks, then the cost of equity will generally be higher for the treasury than for the bank as a whole. To the extent that risks are hedged, the cost of equity will be lower.\nThe Shared-Cost Problem\nMost banks try to use cost accounting systems to push all overhead costs down to the business-unit \nlevel. It is better to allocate only those costs that the business units would incur were they standing \nalone. Unallocated headquarters costs should be kept at headquarters as a cost center. Business units \nshould be encouraged to compare costs of providing services through outsourcing with internal costs. This \nprovides a means of checkin g that internall y provided services are cost-efficient.\nThe shared-cost problem arises from the fact that multiple business units may use the same resource. \nFor example, a teller may provide services for non-interest-bearing checking, money market \naccounts, coupon clipping, and mortgage loan payments. If all these activities are within the same business unit\u2014for example, retail banking\u2014no problem results for valuation at the business-unit level. If the costs are shared between business units\u2014for example, retail banking and the trust \nde\npartment\u2014then an effort should be made to allocate the costs on the basis of services used.\nSummar y\nValuing banks is difficult. From an outsider's point of view, banks are particularly opaque \nbusinesses because of blind pool risk in loan portfolios and inadequate information concerning \nhedging practices. From an insider's perspective, a variety of transfer-pricing schemes are possible. \nWe have discussed an approach that match-funds each business unit for interest rate and credit risk, thereby collecting these risks in a centralized treasury operation where they can be explicitly mana\nged.

In year five, benefits are paid and the reserve is \nremoved from the liability account. Similarly, the company sustains an equivalent decline in assets \nas cash is used to pay policyholders.\nAs this example illustrates, when new insurance business is written, provisions and reserves will \nincrease. This significant liability is undoubtedly part of the operations of the insurance company. \nSince the net present value of writing new policies is usually positive, reserves are a liability that \ncreate value for shareholders. For this reason, it makes sense to use an equity rather than an enterprise approach for valuing insurance companies. The free cash flows to equity holders are discounted at the cost of e\nquity.\nThe major asset of TransAmerica in 1998 was a portfolio of investments recorded at $33.7 billion \non the balance sheet. Roughly 90 percent of these investments were in fixed income securities such as bonds. Insurance companies create value primarily in two ways. First, on the liabilities side of the balance sheet, they try to write policies so that the present value of the expected obligations is less \nthan the present value of the monies flowing from the premiums (net of expenses such as \ncommissions). Second, on the assets side of the balance sheet, they can create value by investing the u\npfront cash received from policyholders at rates of return hi gher than re quired given their risk.\nLooking at TransAmerica's 1998 income statement, you will note that net premium income from \ninsurance policies was $1.8 billion pre-tax, and that net interest income, at $2.3 billion, was even \nhigher. Benefits and claims ($2.9 billion) exceed net premium income. However, the bottom-line profit is positive $1.1 billion profit before taxes. It is not uncommon for benefits and claims to exceed premiums. You could say that an insurance company's profit comes from the time value of holding the policyholder's cash until claims are paid. Most insurance companies do not try to create \nmismatch profits by holding a securities and loan portfolio that is longer in duration than the \nduration of their liabilities. As mentioned in Chapter 21 on the valuation of banks, duration mismatch is not a source of value. Short-term liabilities have to be rolled over at higher rates, makin\ng the nea r-term mismatch profit illusor y because it is offset b y expected lon ger-term losses.\nSome of the other assets and liabilities use unusual terminology, and so a few more definitions \nwould be useful. Separate accounts of $5.5 billion appear on both the assets and liabilities side of the balance sheet. These accounts represent other people's money that is managed by the insurance company. Because this money has no net effect on the insurance company's balance sheet, it is \ncarried in equal amounts as both an asset and a liability. Deferred policy acquisition costs are \ncapitalized commission expenses that are not yet written off. Unearned premium reserves are premiums advanced to the insurance company by its policyholders. Provisions are cash set aside to cover potential, but unrealized, credit losses on the loans made by the insurance company, deferred \ntaxes, and \npension liabilities.

Statutory accounting emphasizes the present solvency of an insurance com\npany, not its potential for profit:\nStatutory accounting principles (SAP) attempt to determine the insurer's ability to satisfy its obligations to \npolicyholders and creditors at all times. Because of the focus on solvency, the statutory balance sheet represents \nassets and liabilities that generally are valued on a conservative basis. Accordingly, certain illiquid assets, such as furniture and fixtures as well as capitalized contract acquisition costs, are assigned no value (and are referred \nto as nonadmitted assets). With respect to liabilities, SAP generally require formula-driven reserves relating to \ninvested assets and benefit reserve liabilities using statutory tables or other conservative assumptions.\n2\nGenerally accepted accounting principles say that financial statements should be prepared on a \ngoing-concern basis. GAAP statements are aimed at providing investors with the information they \nneed to make prudent decisions about whether to keep or acquire shares in a particular insurance company. The regulations governing these reports are not designed to secure and demonstrate the company's solvency, but to make clear their potential for increased earnings, larger dividends, and \noverall \ngrowth.3\nExhibit 22.3 summarizes the major differences between statutory and GAAP accounting. The first \nitem is contract acquisition costs such as commissions paid to salespersons. Following its conservative nature, statutory accounting expenses all of these costs as incurred. GAAP accounting \nattempts to match these upfront expenses with the revenue stream that they generate for the \ninsurance company\u2014the premiums paid each year by policyholders. GAAP defers a portion of these ac\nquisition costs and amortizes them relative to the revenue generated.\nAs mentioned, nonadmitted assets are excluded from the statutory balance sheet and are charged to \nsurplus. This is the equivalent to the book equity that most of us are familiar with in industrial companies. These same nonadmitted assets are capitalized and depreciated under GAAP, similar to industrial com\npanies.\n2 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Proposed Audit and Accounting Guide\u2014Life and Health \nInsurance Entities  (New York, 1998).\n3 S.

Under GAAP, the $35 of new deferred acquisition costs (i.e., commissions) is amortized over five years, at the rate of $7 per year. \nThe $100 of existing deferred acquisition costs is being amortized over five years at the rate of $20 per year. Total amortizat ion of deferred acquisition \ncosts is $27 in 1999 on the GAAP statements. The actual cash paid for commissions is the same and the free cash flow statement will reflect the actual \ncash paid regardless of the accounting. Tax effects of this and other line-item differences are reflected in the change in defe rred taxes item on the free \ncash flow statement.\nWhether we look at GAAP or statutory accounting, the major liability category is called reserves . The level of reserves under statutory accounting is \nhigher ($900 compared with $800 at the beginning of the period) and the change in the level of reserves is also higher ($45 com pared with $40). The \nexplanation for the differences in reserves between GAAP and statutory accounting is due mainly to the more conservative discou nt rates used under \nthe latter a pproach.\nThe result of these differences is that GAAP reports higher operating income than statutory accounting, but also greater net in vestment added to the \nbalance sheet (taking into consideration all balance sheet items such as investments, deferred acquisition costs, and deferred taxes).

In early 1982, \none of the authors met with the chief investment officer of a major West Coast insurance company. The executive's company had roughly $50 million in unrealized capital losses in its bond portfolio because interest rates had risen dramatically in the past year. He also said that the company had about $50 million in realized capital gains elsewhere in its business. An immediate reaction was to \nsuggest a tax offset by taking the losses on the bond portfolio to shelter the taxes on the gains. The \nexecutive rejected the idea \"because our profits would be lower if we realize the capital losses.\" And, he continued, \"our share price depends on our profitability.\" We protested, asking whether he would change his mind if we produced evidence that the marketplace values companies on cash flows, not profits. \"That's irrelevant because our CEO believes that the market follows earnings,\" he \nreplied.

The key to this identity was choosing discount rates that consistently adjusted for the tax benefit of interest expense. We provided formulas for linking the unlevered cost of equity, WACC, and the levered cost of equity to achieve this identit\ny.\nThe formulas that we provided in Chapter 8 were based on the assumption that the tax benefit of \ninterest expense would be discounted at the unlevered cost of equity. Unfortunately, finance theory doesn't tell us unequivocally that this is the correct rate to use. Some would argue that the tax \nbenefit of interest expense should be discounted at the cost of debt or some rate between the cost of \ndebt and the unlevered cost of equity.

At the extreme, consider a company with only $1 of debt.
