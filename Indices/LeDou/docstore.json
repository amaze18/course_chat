No, it\u2019s not about reducing consciousness to \ncognition, cognition to the brain, and the brain to biology. It is \ninstead about how every thing that can be said about you as a living \n thing is subsumed by interactions between biological, neurobiolog-\nical, cognitive, and conscious ways of  being.  These are our realms \nof existence.\nAll living things, all organisms, exist biologically. But some of  these, \nnamely animals, evolved nervous systems, and so they also exist neu-\nrobiologically. Of  these, some can think and plan, and thus exist cog-\nnitively. Finally, some cognitive organisms also exist consciously. All \nthat we are is subsumed within these entwined realms of existence.\nMuch thanks to my wife, Nancy Princenthal, a fantastic writer \nand editor. With her keen eye and sharp mind she made invaluable \ncontributions. Our son, Milo LeDoux, also helped by posing chal-\nlenging questions on key topics, like animal consciousness and con-\nscious AI. It was great working with Robert Lee again. He made \nthe illustrations for my earlier book Anxious, and also created the \noriginal figures in this book.\nI am extremely grateful to colleagues who have spent time talking \nwith me about or reading drafts of  this book.

A new group of pa -\ntients was being given the \u201csplit- brain\u201d operation by a neurosurgeon \nat Dartmouth Medical School, and I got in at just the right time. \nDuring my first year, Mike bought the camper mentioned  earlier, \nand we converted it into a mobile testing lab. Over the next several \nyears, a  couple of other students and I made frequent trips to New \n England with Mike to test  these patients.\nIn his PhD studies, Mike had showed that when the brain was \nsplit, information presented to the right hemi sphere stays  there. \nThis was achieved by instructing the patient to fixate his or her \neyes on a small dot in the center of a projection screen.  Because of  \nthe way the nerves from the eye to the brain are routed, stimuli on \nthe left side of  the screen are directed to the right hemi sphere and \nstimuli to the right to the left hemi sphere. And  because language \nis preferentially represented in the left hemi sphere, the patient cannot \ntalk about information presented only to the right hemi sphere. \nFor example, if only the right hemi sphere was shown a picture of \nan apple, and the patient was asked \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d the pa -\ntient would say something like, \u201cI  didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d  because \nthe vocal left hemi sphere did not pro cess that information. But the \nleft hand, which is preferentially connected with the right hemi-\nsphere, could reach into a bag with several objects and pull the \napple out.\nMike\u2019s PhD research raised the possibility of  two minds living side \nby side inside the head, one in each hemi sphere. But the evidence \nat the time was not conclusive. Even a brief conversation with the \nloquacious left hemi sphere gives you the sense that you are talking \nto a full-on  human being\u2014 you hear about opinions, beliefs, mem -\nories, fears, and hopes.

Paul\u2019s right hemi sphere knew that he \nwas Paul. This is not trivial. A person\u2019s name is a key marker of  their \nidentity, a hook on which hangs much of  what is known about who \nthey are.\nBut Paul was unusual. Unlike most split- brain patients, who have \nlanguage only in their left hemi sphere, Paul could understand spoken \nand written language with both hemi spheres, despite being able to \ntalk only via his left hemi sphere. That\u2019s why we could ask his right \nhemi sphere, \u201cWho are you?\u201d and get a response.  Because the amount \nof information that can be pro cessed in a quick flash is  limited, I \nspoke part of  the question out loud and presented the rest visually. \nAs a result, both hemi spheres heard the word \u201cwho,\u201d but only the \nright hemi sphere saw \u201care you.\u201d\nIn other studies of Paul, we  were able to use  these kinds of  simple \nprobes to show that his right hemi sphere could imagine the  future. \nWhen asked what his goal in life was, the left hand, the behavioral \nagent of  the right hemi sphere, spelled out \u201crace car driver.\u201d Strik -\ningly, the left hemi sphere had declared in conversations with us that \nit wanted to be a draftsman. That two diff  er ent answers emerged \nfrom the same brain was mind- blowing.\nIn yet another study, we presented two pictures to Paul, each po -\nsitioned on diff  er ent sides of  the screen, and instructed him to \npoint to the picture that matched what he saw. For example, the \nleft hemi sphere saw a chicken claw and the right a snow scene. In \nresponse, the left hand pointed to a shovel and the right hand to a \nchicken. When asked why he chose  those, Paul said: I saw a chicken \nclaw so I pointed to a chicken, and you need a shovel to clean out \nthe chicken shed.

Our conversa -\ntion led us to the idea that we all spin tales or narratives to make \nsense of ourselves and our world, a notion that would figure prom -\ninently in our 1978 book The Integrated Mind.\nEver since my studies of Paul, I have been fascinated with ques -\ntions about how our conscious experiences come about in the brain, \nespecially in relation to emotions and memory, and have summa -\nrized updates of my views in my books over the years. But the book \nyou are reading and the one right before, The Deep History of Our -\nselves: The Four- Billion- Year Story of How We Got Conscious Brains,  \nhave a special connection. In a phrase, Deep History  was about \u201cThe \nway we  were\u201d\u2014 how we evolved. And this book is about \u201cThe way \nwe are\u201d\u2014 what it is to be a living  human.\nAnatomy of a Feast\nI serve this book in five courses. The first gives you a taste of  what \nis to come. It raises questions about the value of ancient, entrenched \nnotions of self and person  as ways to define what and who we are. I \nreconceptualize the useful information obtained by empirical re -\nsearch on  these topics and place it in a new framework, one based \nmore on scientific rather than philosophical princi ples. In par  tic-\nu lar, I argue that every thing about what it is to be a  human being \ncan be understood in terms of our biological, neurobiological, cog -\nnitive, and conscious realms of existence.  These make us biological \nbeings with ner  vous systems that can think, plan, and decide, and \nthat can experience our inner thoughts and feelings.\nThe next four parts of  the book delve deeply into  these realms. \nI start by describing how all organisms exist biologically, but some \nof  these (namely animals) have a ner  vous system and exist neuro -\nbiologically.

The body is physical. It is the source \nof aches and pains. But the mind is  mental. It perceives, remembers, \nthinks, believes, feels, and imagines.\n T oday, many of us understand that the  mental aspect of  who we \nare is embedded in the part of  the body known as the brain, and \ntherefore is also part of our physical, bodily existence. Still, even true \nbelievers of  the physical nature of  the mind sometimes feel as though \nit possesses some quality or qualities lacking in other physical sys -\ntems within our body, and even within our brain.

This way of  thinking began to take shape in \nthe seventeenth  century through the writings of Ren\u00e9 Descartes. \nA polymath, Descartes was a phi los o pher, mathematician, and phys -\nicist, and if psy chol ogy and neuroscience had existed, he undoubt -\nedly would have excelled in  those areas, too.\nDescartes viewed the mind as an immaterial, immortal soul. It \nwas both spiritual (connected to God) and  mental (the locus of  \nthought, including conscious thoughts about oneself). With his fa -\nmous statement cogito, ergo sum  (I think, therefore, I am), he tied \npersonal existence to conscious thought, and equated this conscious -\nness with the soul. In his scheme, the conscious mind has agency\u2014 \nthat is, it controls the actions of its physical body, and as a result, \n will be held accountable on  Judgment Day. Other animals exist only \nbodily and, lacking conscious agency, have no afterlife in  either \nheaven or hell.\nJohn Locke, who followed Descartes by a few de cades, rocked \nthe Christian world when he proposed that the core of an individual \nwas not an immaterial soul but a conscious self  that persisted over \ntime. Key to Locke\u2019s position was his novel solution to the prob  lem \nof how one knows they are the same person  today as yesterday. In \n England, where Locke resided, identity was based on social status. \nBut Locke said it instead resulted from the continuity of one\u2019s self \nover time. This was achieved, he proposed, by thinking back to the \npast\u2014 that is, by making one\u2019s self, via conscious memory, the same \nself now as it was then.\nLocke also introduced the idea of a constitution of man,  which he \nsaid encompasses our body, and all our behavioral and  mental fac -\nulties.

The moralist Bishop Butler, for example, talked \nabout two kinds of selves\u2014 one cool and settled (a feeling of  the \nmoment) and the other passionate and / or sensual (a feeling of self- \ninterest). Along similar divisional lines, the phi los o pher Adam Smith, \nknown as the  father of modern economics, described how he \nexamined his own conduct: \u201cI divide myself, as it  were, into two \npersons.\u201d  These he referred to as the examiner and the judge. He also \ntook the self into the social realm, viewing one\u2019s relationship to  others \nas a function of one\u2019s relationship to one\u2019s self.  Later, Alexander \nBain noted that we look at our thoughts with a \u201cwarm eye,\u201d with a \n\u201ctenderness for that activity\u201d as if it was another person.\nButler also introduced a notion of  the self as the core of a moni -\ntoring system that maintains the normalcy of  human nature (an idea \nthat has become popu lar  today in cognitive science). Deviance, in -\ncluding  mental illness and criminality, then came to be thought of \nas a failure to monitor and was thus a weakness of  the self.\nBy the eigh teenth  century, the vocabulary of self had proliferated \nin everyday language with the use of  terms like self- worth, self-  \nesteem, self- conscious, self- love, self- praise, self- pride, self- contained, \nself- regard, self- made, self- interest, self- confidence, self- aware, self-  \nmonitoring, self- involved, self- care, and selfish.  These reinforced the \nidea that  there is some entity or  thing called the self.\nDescartes\u2019s immaterial soul continued the Christian tradition \nof treating the soul as the basis of individuality and personal re -\nsponsibility.

He was more concerned with how the self  \nwas constructed by consciousness. And his self, unlike Descartes\u2019s \nsoul, had properties by which it could be known empirically like \nany other natu ral object. This idea planted the seed that the con -\nscious self might be the subject of scientific inquiry.\nBut it was not  until the late nineteenth  century that a scientific \nendeavor emerged that could pursue such an idea. It was then, in \nGermany, that the methods of natu ral science, notably physiology, \nbegan to be applied to the philosophical prob  lems of  the mind, and \nespecially to consciousness. The result was the field of experimental \npsy chol ogy.\nThe main approach taken by  these scientific psychologists was the \nsame one that phi los o phers had relied on in their analyses of \nconsciousness\u2014 introspection. What the German psychologists \nadded was a way to treat the results of self- introspections as scientific \ndata with strict rules for both how to go about the introspective pro -\ncess and how to rec ord the observations.\nIn the United States, one of  the early pioneers of  the new psy-\nchol ogy was William  James.

But it was not the \nsame self- conscious mind that the forefathers of psy chol ogy had been \nconcerned with. The cognitive mind was, instead, portrayed as an \ninformation pro cessing system, rather than a system that makes sub -\njective experiences. It was in a sense unconscious, but not in the deep \nFreudian sense. The unconscious aspects of cognition  were mostly \nframed as pro cesses that support mind and be hav ior  behind the scenes \nwithout explicit conscious content\u2014 processes that create repre sen-\nta tions by manipulating symbols. Cognitive science was not anti-  \nconscious, but it was disinclined to investigate it, since so much could \nbe explained without making recourse to consciousness. Over time, \nas behaviorism receded in psy chol ogy, consciousness, including the \nconscious self, slowly began to make its way back.\n These days, the seventeenth- century Western philosophical fu -\nsion of self and consciousness, which objectified the self as a natu ral \nentity of  the physical world, is alive and well. This is why we think \nof who we are as an individual in terms of  the word self. It is why we \ntreat our self as an entity with properties and call on this entity to \nexplain our thoughts and actions.

More recently, but \nin a similar vein, the phi los o pher Daniel Dennett and  others have de -\nscribed the self as illusory. Some have noted that discussions about the \nself are  really discussions about other  things; the self is a gratuitous no -\ntion. I think Thomas Metzinger truly hit the nail on its head when \nhe said that \u201cnobody ever had or was a self.\u201d A similar perspective has \nrecently been offered by the psychologist Zolt\u00e1n Dienes.\nAnother obvious prob  lem with the traditional notion of  the self \nis that it remains a narrowly focused conception promoted by Eu-\nro pean phi los o phers and imported into modern psy chol ogy and \nneuroscience. Cultural traditions that treat the self and other aspects \nof  human existence differently have received less attention.\nEfforts have been made to get around the vari ous critiques. The \nphi los o pher Shaun Gallagher pointed out that a common strategy is \nto avoid directly focusing on the self  by modifying it with other \nterms. Examples include the conscious, unconscious, core, autobio -\ngraphical, narrative, existential, social, embodied, and synaptic self.\nSimilarly, the psychologist Ulric Neisser suggested a focus on as-\npects of the self, as opposed to the self itself.

Experimental psy chol ogy, psychiatry, and brain research \n were all emerging. It was also a time when the notion of personality  \nbegan to offer an alternative to self as a way to think about what a \n human being is.\nAs a term, personality  is derived from the Greek persona,  which \nreferred to a theatrical mask that expressed traits other than  those \nof the individual wearing the mask (recall that the Greeks did not \nhave a word for self per se, but did talk about persons ).  Later, person  \nwould come to have spiritual,  legal, and ethical implications. But it \nwas not  until the late nineteenth  century that the psychological \nmeaning that personality has  today took hold, when the French phi-\nlos o pher Charles Renouvier used the term to refer to the embodied  \nand empirically knowable  individual. French physicians around this \ntime began to treat one\u2019s personality as something prone to illness \nand disease, and consequently, like any other medical prob  lem, po -\ntentially treatable. An 1885 book introduced the notion of alternating \npersonality,  which  later came to be referred to as multiple personality \ndisorder,  and more recently, dissociative identity disorder.\nThe medicalization of personality in the nineteenth  century \ncan be seen as an effort to conceive of  what  people are in a more", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1434, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05cca05c-0bca-40c6-b9ad-90e346b97dcd": {"__data__": {"id_": "05cca05c-0bca-40c6-b9ad-90e346b97dcd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/LeDou/Joseph E.

He used questionnaires to collect data \nabout  people\u2019s backgrounds and be hav ior, and applied statistical anal -\nyses to make sense of  the results. He also introduced the use of \ncommon- language words about mind and be hav ior to label his \nbottom-up statistical findings about personality. Greatly influenced \nby Darwin, Galton believed that  human physical and  mental capaci -\nties  were inherited traits, and was among  those who embraced eu -\ngenics to improve the quality of  human genes by excluding from \nsociety  those thought to be inferior.\nDespite the stain of eugenics, the trait approach was reinvigorated \nin the twentieth  century by Gordon Allport. Early in his  career All -\nport visited Freud and left feeling that to understand personality he \nneeded to focus on  factors more obvious than  those hidden in the \ndepths of  the unconscious. Like Galton, he took a bottom-up ap -\nproach, compiling a list of more than four thousand words related \nto what a person is. Raymond Cattell also applied statistical analyses \nof  people\u2019s self- reported responses to questionnaires. He whittled \ndown Allport\u2019s much longer list to just sixteen words.\nCurrently, the so- called big five model is the most widely ac -\ncepted trait scheme. It proposes five trait groupings: openness, con -\nscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Within \n these are higher- order clusters  and lower- order facets of personality (for \nexample, in the extraversion cluster, warmth and gregariousness are \nfacets). Both genes and experience are thought to affect the big-  five \ntraits.\nTrait theory has its critics. For example, Henry Murray, who \ndubbed his motivational theory of personality personology,  chided \ntrait theorists for reducing personality to statistical events, asking, \nwhere is the individual, the person, in trait research?\nA popu lar con temporary variant on trait theory emphasizes stable \ntemperaments based on ge ne tic differences.

In -\ntelligence came to be thought of as an inherited  factor, and was \nsometimes used, as Galton did, to promote eugenics and other racist \nideas. Eventually, IQ tests, like many standardized tests,  were shown \nto be culturally biased.  There is no mea sur able entity in a person \nthat constitutes their intelligence. Some have suggested that intel -\nligence is nothing more than what an intelligence test mea sures, \nwhich is, in the end, a decision based on someone\u2019s ideas about \nwhat intelligence is.

I am just pointing out that the person \nI refer to as I, as opposed to some other person, ate the cake. The \nself is just a nickname, a description, we apply to systems in us \nthat do  things.\nThe self, in short, boils down to the cognitive capacities that \nmonitor your body and  mental states, and that use memories of  who \nyou are in relation to your pre sent needs, expectations, capacities, \nand limitations to make predictions about how to act. Since, by \ndefinition, it is you (your brain and body) that is  doing all this, \ncalling on a self  to explain what is being done is redundant, and \nhence unnecessary.

T yler Volk, my long -\ntime colleague at NYU, and co- founder with me of  the rock band \nthe Amygdaloids, described evolutionary transitions as stages of \nrelative continuity that are ratcheted one to the next by changes of \nstate. Volk referred to the resulting state changes as dynamic realms,  \nwhich inspired my notion of realms of existence.\nThe primordial, biological, realm has existed for roughly 3.7 bil -\nlion years. It sustains life, and it is a preexisting condition for the \nper sis tence over time of any kind of living  thing,  whether a single- \ncell microbe, such as a bacterium, or a complex multicellular or -\nganism, such as a plant or animal. The neurobiological realm arrived \nbetween six and seven hundred million years ago, when animals \nin ven ted ner  vous systems. Ner  vous systems evolved as extensions of, \nand supplements to, the biological way of life, allowing coordina -\ntion of spatially separated internal body functions, and more effi -\ncient control of  be hav iors directed  toward the external environment. \n These basic neural pro cesses  were then the template from which \nsome animals evolved the ability to meet their survival needs by \nusing internal repre sen ta tions and  mental models to flexibly choose \namong hy po thet i cal options for action without having to risk the \nconsequences of actually testing the options in the environment. \nRefinements of   these capacities became the cognitive foundation \nof the kind of mental- state consciousness we  humans possess, which \nallows each  human to consciously know that we are a living  thing \nwith a personal past and some undetermined  future. This does not \nmean that all other animals lack consciousness. It just means that \n those that are conscious are not conscious in the same way we are, \njust as they do not walk or communicate the way we do.

It refers to the body\u2019s ability to predict  future needs and make \nanticipatory adjustments. Homeostasis restores balance, whereas al -\nlostasis seeks to maintain optimal functioning through anticipation.\nA key role of homeostasis is ensuring a chemical milieu suitable \nfor metabolism. In eukaryotic cells, metabolism is the job of  tiny \nenergy machines called mitochondria. Each cell in the body makes \nits own energy by using oxygen to break down glucose. T o achieve \nthis outcome, the fluids surrounding the cells must have a suitable \nconcentration supply of glucose and oxygen, as well as ions (cal -\ncium, potassium, sodium), minerals (iron, magnesium), and a proper \npH (acid- base balance).  These chemicals are delivered throughout \nthe body via the bloodstream. Blood flow requires that the heart be \nbeating. And  because the chemical reaction that breaks glucose \ndown requires a narrow temperature range, this too has to be pre -\ncisely regulated. Each of   these steps is controlled by feedback \npro cesses that stabilize the internal milieu, making it pos si ble for \nmetabolism to efficiently produce energy. The health and vitality of  \nthe organism depends on metabolism and homeostasis, which to -\ngether are referred to as metabolic homeostasis.

Metabolism is a \nfar cry from the mysterious, nonmaterial forces proposed by vital -\nists. Y et despite the achievements of science, vitalism continues.\n T oday, vitalism is a tacit manifestation of spiritualism, with vari ous \nterms used to name non- material essences that are assumed to be \npart of life. Some terms come right out the vitalist tradition ( vis \nessentialis, vis vitalis,  \u00e9lan vital,  vital impetus, life force, life spirit), and \n others are associated with Greek philosophy, Chris tian ity (soul, \nspirit), or Eastern spiritualism (chi, brio, ki, prana, shakti, purusha, \nj\u014driki, astral body).\nBelief in a soul or afterlife, or in spiritualism in general,  will prob-\nably always exist among  humans. That is not my concern. What \ndoes trou ble me is that such ideas are sometimes treated as legiti -\nmate scientific explanations. Vitalism, as Bernard said, has no place \nin science.\nSome scientists are deeply religious, or spiritual in other ways. But \nas Cicero and Locke, and many  others since, have said, we assume \ndiff  er ent roles (personas) in diff  er ent situations. So long as scientists \nare scientists when they do science, they can lead their non- scientific \nlives as they choose, and no harm is done. But when they use their \nscientific credentials to give credence to non- scientific, and even \nanti- scientific, points of view, harm most definitely can result.\n Things can also get tricky when scientists interact scientifically \nwith phi los o phers who hold positions such as mind- body dualism \nor panpsychism (the belief  that consciousness permeates all of na -\nture, living and inert).  These are perfectly legitimate philosophical \nareas of inquiry, but that  doesn\u2019t make them legitimate scientific \ntopics.\nDualism and panpsychism have both been linked with vitalism, \nand some scientists have developed scientific theories compatible", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2058, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a17cf96-2495-4c3a-af20-820c96f3d7e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a17cf96-2495-4c3a-af20-820c96f3d7e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/LeDou/Joseph E.

Notably, \nthe external environment typically includes other cells that are also \ninteracting homeostatically with that same environment and with \neach other.\nThe transition from unicellular to multicellular eukaryotic life re -\nquired a solution for the prob  lem of how the cells could interact to \nmaintain the unity of larger, more complex organisms. Some basic \nprinci ples of cell- to- cell interaction  were worked out by cells that \nadhered to one another as colonies.  These are not true multicel -\nlular organisms, however, as they are simply aggregations of con  ve-\nnience. For example, by colonizing, eukaryotic prey could achieve \nsafety in numbers from eukaryotic predators. Another survival ad -\nvantage of colonization results from a division of  labor. A single cell \nliving solo has to control movement, digestion, reproduction, and \nso on. In a colony, diff  er ent cells take on diff  er ent tasks. This divi -\nsion of  labor is achieved by the vari ous cells releasing chemicals that \ninhibit some of  the normal functions of other cells by altering gene \nactivity in the group. The resulting specializations, though, are op -\nportunistic and transactional. If a cell defects from the colony, its \ngenes resume their normal functions and the cell survives solo.\nProkaryotes (for example, bacteria) and eukaryotes (for example, \nprotozoa and algae) form colonies, but only eukaryotes found a way \nto exist as true multicellular organisms. In fact, true multicellular \norganisms evolved via transformations of unicellular colonies.\nA true multicellular starts life as a single cell (fertilized egg), the \n mother of all other cells that  will come to be the organism.

But  there\u2019s a \npar tic u lar perspective on this duality of animal life that had a major \nimpact on how this book unfolded.\nRomer\u2019s Body Duality\nEarly on in writing this book, I stumbled across an article by the \npaleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer that was initially published \nin the 1950s, then re- published in the 1970s in a book on evolu -\ntionary biology. It escaped my notice, and, as far as I can tell, that \nof most neuroscientists, for the next forty- eight years.\nIt\u2019s not that Romer himself  was overlooked. He was widely rec -\nognized for his work on the anatomical changes required for evo -\nlutionary transition from fish to amphibians, and has been described \nas one of  the impor  tant evolutionary anatomists of  the twentieth \n century. His 1955 textbook, The Vertebrate Body,  is considered the \nbible of comparative anatomy. Y et the par  tic u lar paper in question \nseems to have seldom been cited in the mainstream lit er a ture on \nbrain anatomy, and citations that did occur  were mostly in technical \npapers on very specific topics. For me, though, it ended up be -\ncoming a crucial part of my conception of  this book.\nI have to admit, it took several readings. At first it seemed like a \nstraightforward reworking of  the ideas of  Aristotle, Bichat, Bernard, \nand Cannon. But the more I delved into to Romer, the more in-\nter est ing I found what he had to say.\nRomer focused on two classes of muscle tissues known to be pos -\nsessed by vertebrates. Striated muscles make up much of  the body\u2019s \nflesh and are attached to the skeleton.  These respond rapidly in con -\ntrolling body movements in the external world, and they underlie \nbe hav ior. Smooth muscles, by contrast, are traditionally associated \nwith inner organs and glands that take care of digestive, respiratory, \nreproductive, and other physiological functions.  These contract more \nslowly than striated muscles.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1985, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08fab38a-7acc-4400-ba51-6784eabd3f10": {"__data__": {"id_": "08fab38a-7acc-4400-ba51-6784eabd3f10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/LeDou/Joseph E.

The mix of   these \nproteins in striated muscles underlies their contractile efficiency, and \nthe way the proteins are arranged gives the appearance of vis i ble \nbands, striations, that are the basis for their name.\nBut Romer noted that the association of striated muscles with \nskeletal movement and smooth muscles with the inner tissues was \nan oversimplification. In par  tic u lar, in some vertebrates, some \nsmooth muscles have striations. While the existence of   these hy -\nbrid (striated / smooth) muscles was known for some time, it was \ntreated as a minor anomaly. Romer, however, saw a significant evo -\nlutionary pro cess at work.\nLike Bernard, Romer built on the importance of  the vertebrate \ntransition from an aquatic to a terrestrial lifestyle. He proposed that \nin order to meet the metabolic challenges imposed by the new en -\nvironment, early amphibians needed more efficient muscles in the \nheart, lungs, and digestive track. This led to the addition of rapidly \ncontracting proteins in some smooth muscles, which gave  those \nmuscles striations similar to skeletal muscles.\nRomer concluded that since the presence of striations is not \n limited to muscles that move the skeleton in space, the way to think \nabout the relation of muscles to body function is not in terms of  \nthe distinction between striated and smooth categories. Instead, he \nsaid, the key distinction is between somatic (behavioral) and visceral \n(so- called vegetative) body systems, regardless of  the muscles  those \nsystems use. The implications of Romer\u2019s conclusion are perhaps \nbest left to his own words:\nIn many regards the vertebrate organism,  whether fish or \nmammal, is a well- knit unit structure.

T o eviscerate  means to remove the innards, or offal as they are \ncalled in culinary circles. Scientifically, the viscera include three \nkinds of  tissues. The first are the major organs (heart, lungs, gut, \nliver, gall bladder, kidneys, and brain). The secretory tissues that re -\nlease hormones and fluids are the second (adrenal medulla, adrenal \ncortex, pancreas, gonads, thyroid, parathyroid, pineal, salivary, lac -\nrimal, and sweat glands). The third are blood vessels (arteries and \nveins). Most visceral tissues are located in the cavities of  the ab -\ndomen, chest, and pelvis, though a few are in the neck and head \nregions; and the blood vessels run through all body tissues, including \nbones. Visceral tissues keep us alive. They take care of  the life-  \nsustaining homeostatic pro cesses that allow metabolism to function \nin all the cells of  the body, moment to moment.\nBesides  these scientific reasons,  there is a social reason to avoid \nthe term vegetative.

As \nanimals go, sponges are very primitive  because they have  limited \nkinds of  body tissues. Although present- day sponges do not possess \na ner vous system, they have ge ne tic and molecular building blocks \nthat underlie the ner  vous systems of animals that evolved from them. \nAnd sponges got  these from their single-cell protozoan ancestors. \nBoth used  these building blocks for non- neural purposes. For ex -\nample, one impor  tant building block is a class of cells known as \nadhesion molecules.  These hold individual protozoa together to \nform colonies; they also hold together the cells that make up body \ntissues (including neural tissues) in sponges and other animals.\nAbout 700 million years ago, Cnidaria, the phylum that in -\ncludes jellyfish and hydra, diverged from sponges.  These animals \nare radial in shape, possessing a single axis, a top and bottom, but \nhaving neither a front- back nor left- right distinction. They, unlike \nsponges, have ner  vous systems. All of  this suggests that the key \nevent that made neurons and synapses pos si ble in Cnidaria was not \na sudden arrival of novel genes, but instead the use of existing genes \nin a new way.\nThe Cnidarian ner  vous system consists of a nerve net, a collec -\ntion of interconnected neurons diffusely distributed throughout their \nskin. That this relationship between neurons and skin lives on is \nshown by the fact that the ner  vous system and skin of animals are \nboth derived from the same embryonic layer (the ectoderm) during \nearly development.\nOf the Cnidaria, jellyfish have been studied most extensively. \nThey have receptors for light, touch, and gravity in the outer skin \nof their umbrella- like dome, and under  neath are muscles that propel \nmovement.

All of  the major animal phyla \nwe live among  today  were in existence by the end of  the Cambrian, \nalthough considerable species diversification within each phylum \ncontinued to take place.\nArmed with power ful species- typical reactions, Cambrian bilat -\nerals became predators and prey, triggering evolutionary arms races  in \nwhich animals continuously adapted in response to features of other \nanimals in ways that made each more competitive\u2014 becoming \nbigger, stronger, better weaponized or better defended, and able to \ninvade new environmental niches. Predation and defense  were likely \nnot what initiated the Cambrian Explosion, but they certainly con -\ntributed to its grandeur.\nMuch of  the waking life of animals is spent searching for and con -\nsuming food by using, at a minimum, complex combinations of \nreflexes and fixed reactions.  Whether predator or prey, an animal \nmust continuously replenish the nutrient resources needed to main -\ntain metabolic homeostasis.  Because food is not always easily avail -\nable, it must be sought out through foraging.\nAccording to Thomas Hills, bilaterals in the Cambrian employed \na very basic and ancient food- foraging strategy. It is called area- restricted \nsearch,  and involves two interrelated components that balance ex-\nploring  a large area against exploiting  local resources. The exploring \ncomponent uses fast movements to do a cursory search over an \nextensive area. When food is found, the strategy shifts to a more in -\ntensive examination of a small area by using slow movements and \nfrequent turning  until  doing so stops being fruitful.\nThis foraging pattern is controlled by the reflexive and fixed re -\naction components of  the organism\u2019s locomotor circuitry.

This pro -\nvided them with novel advantages in foraging and defending, and \nbecame the basis for new arms races based on associative learning. As \nSimona Ginsburg and Eva  Jablonka argue, one consequence of  the \nemergence of  this neural centralization was the ability to learn rela -\ntionships, or associations, between stimuli, such as the taste of food \nand its appearance. This development, according to Ginsburg and  \nJablonka, had a profound effect on the course of animal evolution:\nAlthough the evolutionary emergence of associative learning \nrequired only small modifications in already existing memory \nmechanisms . . .  once this type of learning appeared on the \nevolutionary scene, it led to extreme diversifying se lection at \nthe ecological level: it enabled animals to exploit new niches, \npromoted new types of relations and arms races, and led to \nadaptive responses that became fixed through ge ne tic accom -\nmodation pro cesses.\nAssociative learning is for the most part a pro cess of reinforcement \nlearning,  in which a connection is made between stimuli with bio -\nlogically significant reinforcing consequences and neutral stimuli that \nco- occur (sights or odors). As a result, the neutral stimuli become \ncues that predict the significant stimulus and elicit anticipatory in -\nnate behavioral and physiological responses that prepare the animal \nfor acquiring a beneficial outcome (consuming nutrition) or averting a \npotentially harmful one (attack by a predator).\nY ou are likely familiar with the form of associative reinforcement \nlearning called Pavlovian conditioning.

That is,  after this conditioning, the sound \nalone would cause the dogs to salivate in anticipation of  the food \nto come.\nAssociative learning contrasts with non- associative  learning, which \ninvolves a single stimulus event rather than an association between \ntwo stimuli. A prime example is habituation. For example, if  the \ndome of a jellyfish is touched repeatedly, it habituates (stops con -\ntracting its escape muscles). Another kind of non- associative learning \nis sensitization. With sensitization,  after strong stimulation on one \npart of  the jellyfish body, a weak stimulus on another part of  the \nbody elicits a strong response. Unlike in associative learning, the two \nstimuli never occur together\u2014 the strong stimulus just primes the \nbody to respond to the weaker one.\nGinsburg and  Jablonka\u2019s suggestion that associative learning \nevolved by small modifications of an existing memory mechanisms \nwas about non- associative learning. Supporting their hypothesis are \nfindings by Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel showing that neural mech -\nanisms under lying associative Pavlovian conditioning differ only \nslightly from  those involved in non- associative sensitization.\nAnother kind of associative reinforcement pro cess also seems to \nhave emerged in the Cambrian period. It is called instrumental \nlearning.  Pavlovian associative reinforcement learning involves con -\nnecting novel stimuli to biologically significant stimuli, allowing the \nneutral stimuli to come to control innate responses. But in instru -\nmental learning, the animal acquires a new (non- innate) response. \nThe simplest kind, and the one that likely occurred during the \nCambrian, is called stimulus- response habit learning.  This occurs when \nenvironmental stimuli are connected to behavioral outcomes by \nreinforcers.

A second line of \ndescent started, too. From it therapsids,  another amniote, evolved. \nMammals, a subgroup of  therapsids, diverged  later.\nThe legs of  the early amniote common ancestor of reptiles and \ntherapsids hung from its sides. Reptiles retained this body plan, but \ntherapsids came up with something diff  er ent: legs directly under-\nneath the body trunk.  Because of  this arrangement they  were able to \nbreathe and run at the same time when escaping predators or cap -\nturing prey. This was a tremendous advantage, but demanded a lot of \nenergy, and so required them to consume more food and use more \noxygen than reptiles. The resulting higher metabolic rates produced \nbody heat, which allowed therapsids to maintain an internal body \ntemperature through metabolism. In other words, they  were endo -\nthermic (warm- blooded). And they had a visual system that allowed \nthem to see well and forage during daytime or at night. Reptiles, \nbeing cold- blooded, had to heat their bodies externally during day -\nlight; at night they  were sessile in order to conserve heat.\nA mass extinction about 250 million years ago wiped out much \nof animal and plant life. Dinosaurs, with their lower- energy, exo -\nthermic (cold-blooded) bodies, survived better than did the higher- \nenergy therapsids. Even so, some small- bodied, low- energy- demanding \ntherapsids, known as cynodonts,  survived. Slowly, cynodonts gave up \ndaytime foraging and the visual capacities that support it, and instead \nled nocturnal lives. Mammals evolved from  these nocturnal cynodonts \nabout 210 million years ago.\nEarly mammals, like their cynodont ancestors, had small bodies \nand  were nocturnal.

This, he said, allowed mammals to use feelings to \nflexibly control be hav ior, freeing them from the rigid instinctual \nheritage of reptiles. The limbic system included subcortical forebrain \nareas such as the amygdala and cortical areas such as the hippo -\ncampus, cingulate gyrus, and orbital region. What tied  these areas \ntogether, in his view, was connectivity with the hypothalamus.  These \nconnections, in turn, he said, made it pos si ble for emotions to con -\ntrol survival be hav iors and the visceral responses of  the body that \nsupport  those be hav iors.\nThe limbic cortical areas are all located medially in the brains of \nall mammals\u2014 with the allocortex in the medial temporal lobe and \nthe meso- cortex in the medial frontal lobe. Imagine the hemi spheres \nof the brain as a hotdog bun. The white part, vis i ble only when \nthe bun is pulled apart, is analogous to the limbic cortical areas. \nThe brown outer part of  the hotdog bun is like the neocortex in the \nlateral parts of  the hemi spheres. In early mammals, the neocortex \nconsisted mainly of  the sensory and motor cortex, and was primarily \nused for controlling be hav ior in responses to sensory stimuli.  These \nforebrain areas expanded in size and complexity in primates. In ad -\ndition, primates added new areas of neocortex that engaged in the \ncomplex integration of sensory information across modalities in \nthe temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. This so- called multimodal \nassociative cortex  allowed primates to reach new heights in cogni -\ntion, and in  humans, language- based cognition.\nSummarizing this triune brain, MacLean noted:\nMan, it appears, has inherited essentially three brains.

The axons of   these \nganglia cause the tissues to respond by contraction or relaxation, \nor, in the case of endocrine glands, to release hormones into the \nbloodstream.\nLangley conceived of  the ANS as having two components that \nwork in opposition. The sympathetic ner  vous system,  he said, is prewired \nwith innate discharge patterns that are sufficient to control the physi -\nological functions of  the viscera. The parasympathetic system,  by con -\ntrast, was said to operate alongside the sympathetic system (hence the \ndesignation para), and counteract the sympathetic system\u2019s effects and \nrestore equilibrium. Both systems  were believed to affect all visceral \norgans and glands in a singular, all or nothing, reflexive fashion.\nA key feature of  the somatic ner  vous system is that it has sensory \nand motor components. For example, if you touch a hot stove, sen -\nsory messages travel to the spinal cord and automatically cause your \nhand to withdraw. But ANS ganglia, especially the sympathetic gan -\nglia, control visceral responses without the benefit of sensations \nfrom the viscera. For this reason, Langley viewed the ANS as a motor \nsystem.\nWhile Langley\u2019s terminology is still used  today, our con temporary \nunderstanding has led to several major revisions. For example, it is no \nlonger accepted that the two components each respond in an all- or- \nnothing way, affecting all visceral tissues similarly. Instead, it is thought \nthat diff  er ent situations elicit subtly diff  er ent patterns of activation of  \nthe visceral organs by each part of  the ANS. And the parasympathetic \ncomponent, which was often treated as secondary to the sympathetic \nsystem, is no longer seen as a mere counterforce to sympathetic re -\nsponses. Moreover, the ANS is no longer viewed as simply a motor \nsystem. Instead, visceral tissues respond to mechanical pressure and \nchemical stimuli (oxygen or carbon dioxide). Nerve endings in vis -\nceral organs even transmit viscerosensory messages to the hindbrain \nvia the parasympathetic vagus nerve.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2182, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ded5fb63-2ee2-486c-a219-7fcb62f6c75f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ded5fb63-2ee2-486c-a219-7fcb62f6c75f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/LeDou/Joseph E.

The neurobiologist William Blessing, for example, \nhas forcefully argued that the concept of  the ANS has outlived its \nusefulness. Nevertheless, the ANS, like the limbic system and triune \nbrain, lives on, despite such scientific challenges.\nWhile the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of  the \nANS have historically received most of  the attention, a third part \nalso exists. This enteric ner  vous system  consists of millions of neurons \nthat are associated with the digestive tract, but also with cardiac and \nsome other visceral tissues. In the late twentieth  century it gained \nscientific attention, and was nicknamed the gut brain,  which gar -\nnered it a place in the public imagination.

First, as we just saw, the parasympa -\nthetic vagus nerve sends signals to the hindbrain about the state of  \nthe body. Langley knew this but downplayed it. Second, visceral sen -\nsations in the hindbrain clearly connect with the midbrain and fore -\nbrain. As early as 1884, William  James had proposed that visceral \nsensations are crucial to the conscious experience of emotions, \nwhich would require forebrain reception of signals from the viscera. \n Either Langley did not know about  James\u2019s view or he dismissed it.\nAnother way that Langley was wrong about the ANS and the \nbrain was in his equation of forebrain function within conscious -\nness, including the volitional control of  be hav ior. His logic:  because \ncontrol of  the ANS is automatic (unconscious and non- volitional), \nit must take place totally in the periphery and brainstem, not the \nforebrain.

In other words, just  because the ANS operates unconsciously \n doesn\u2019t mean that the forebrain is not involved in its control.\nThe involvement of  the forebrain in ANS functions had actually \nbegun to come to light in Langley\u2019s time. During the early twentieth \n century, German researchers reported that electrical stimulation \nof the subcortical forebrain, especially the hypothalamus, elicited \nchanges in cardiovascular and other visceral activities. Around the \nsame time, Walter Cannon, of homeostasis fame, discovered that \nadrenaline and noradrenaline released from the adrenal medulla \nduring fight- flight and other emergency reactions was due to hypo -\nthalamic activation of  the ANS.

Many of  the inputs to the hypothalamus relevant to \nvisceral control come from the limbic region of  the forebrain (recall \nthe distinction between the \u201climbic forebrain\u201d anatomical concept \nand the problematic \u201climbic system\u201d functional concept). More \nrecent work has shown that the amygdala and some other limbic \nregions (including several relatively primitive areas of medial meso-  \ncortical prefrontal cortex, such as the prelimbic, orbital, anterior \n cingulate and insula cortex) also have direct connections with mid -\nbrain and hindbrain areas that control sympathetic and parasympa -\nthetic activities.\nIt\u2019s worth pausing  here to note that subcortical brain areas like \nthe amygdala, hypothalamus, and basal ganglia have subdivisions that \nhave functional roles. For example, the lateral region of  the amyg -\ndala in mammals receives sensory inputs, while the central amyg -\ndala area connects with visceral control areas of  the hypothalamus \nand brainstem.

Recall the two kinds of non- associative \nlearning pro cesses discussed previously\u2014 habituation and sensitiza -\ntion. A loud noise can make your heart beat faster, but with repeti -\ntion you  will become used to the noise and have a milder response. \nA strong stimulus like a loud noise or an electric shock can also \nsensitize you, causing your heart to beat faster to other stimuli pres  ent \nin the moment that that normally would not affect you.\nBut visceral reflexes can also be conditioned associatively, as in \nPavlov\u2019s conditioning of dogs to salivate when they hear the sound \nthat usually comes before a treat. This kind of learning depends on \nthe convergence in the brain of sensory cir  cuits that pro cess the neu -\ntral sound and the food reinforcer.\nSurprisingly, despite how widely known Pavlov\u2019s study is, the an -\natomical details of how it works in the brain are not well under -\nstood. This is most likely  because saliva is difficult to collect and \nprecisely mea sure in animals that are being conditioned and tested. \nBut other kinds of conditioned visceral reflexes have been studied \nmore extensively.

He called this special sensory universe an \nanimal\u2019s umwelt.  His point was that that  there is no single objective \nsensory real ity; the world out  there is diff  er ent for each kind of or -\nganism, and it can be understood only in terms of  the experiential \ncapacities of  the individual organism,  whether it is a single cell or a \ncomplex animal.\nSensory pro cessing starts with sensory detectors, specialized re -\nceptors that are \u201ckeyed\u201d to the par  tic u lar stimulus qualities of each \nsensory modality. In animals with a CNS, the receptors do an ini -\ntial analy sis and then send the results, via peripheral sensory nerves, \nto the sensory system in the animal\u2019s brain, which constructs its sen -\nsory \u201creal ity,\u201d its umwelt, in a species- typical way.\nThis is pos si ble  because the basic wiring of an individual\u2019s brain \nfollows a species- typical ge ne tic brain plan. While an animal is still \nin the womb, long before explicit interactions with the  actual sen -\nsory world routinely take place, genet ically controlled patterns of \nspontaneous neural activity begin to shape sensory connectivity in \na way that is compatible with the sensory environment in which \nits species evolved. As sensory connections develop, they begin \nto transmit some sensation prenatally (for example, sounds from the \nouter world).\nAn animal\u2019s experiences with its sensory world  after birth are also \na crucial  factor in creating the synaptic connections that make its \nsensory systems function properly. For example, studies conducted \nin the 1960s by David Hubel and T orsten Wiesel showed that sur -\ngical closure of one eye of an animal shortly  after birth prevented \ncells in the visual areas in the neocortex from having the proper \ninputs from that eye. This led to prob  lems in depth perception, \nwhich requires integration of inputs from both eyes. If  the eye was \nsurgically closed during a narrow time period early in life, the so- \ncalled critical period, the effects  were lifelong, whereas if  the eye \nwas closed  after that period, the effects  were only temporary.

There are, of course, differences in complexity, but they are \nmostly variations on a common theme.\nReflexes\nReflexes, as noted  earlier, are innate motor programs that are genet-\nically preordained to be activated by specific stimuli.  These motor \nprograms are mostly built into cir  cuits in the spinal cord, and / or the \nbrainstem. Peripheral sensory nerves bring sensory information into \nthe CNS motor program from peripheral receptors, and peripheral \nmotor nerves connect the CNS cir  cuits to the muscles. Although no \nbe hav ior is strictly inborn or strictly due to learning, some, like re -\nflexes, are more innate than  others. As with visceral reflexes, somatic \nreflexes can be modulated by higher levels of control in the forebrain.\nA given reflex typically engages a  limited set of specific muscles. \nBut in complex be hav iors, multiple reflexes are often engaged si mul-\nta neously. For example, walking is a voluntary, often goal- directed, \nactivity, but under lying the act itself are numerous reflexes that con -\ntrol the coordinated movement of one\u2019s two legs and arms, all while \nmaintaining balance and posture. The basic coordination pro cesses \nbegin to unfold in early life  under the direction of a developmental \nge ne tic program, but much trial- and- error learning is also required \nfor the activity to become second nature. Once learned, movements \nlike this, which involve precisely timed contractions and relaxations \nof many muscles throughout the body, depend on cir  cuits in the \ncerebellum region of  the hindbrain. We know this in part  because \nwhen the cerebellum is damaged, the person suffers devastating \nlosses of control over their movements.\nAlthough animals are born prewired with basic stimulus- response \nreflex connections, other reflexes can be acquired through Pavlovian \nassociative learning.

Once the pairing \noccurs, the sound alone  will elicit the reflex. The sound and shock \nsensory pathways converge in the cerebellum, which is the key site \nfor associative learning of   these reflexes by the brain.

We can easily tell a pos si ble evolutionary story about \nsuch stimuli.  Because they  were particularly dangerous to our pri -\nmate ancestors, snakes, spiders, and heights are common triggers of \nphobic anxiety in  people. Responding to stimuli associated with \nreproduction, by contrast, helps our species persist, but can also be \nproblematic, such as when one is hyperaroused or has a sexual ad -\ndiction or stalking disorder.\nSurvival be hav iors depend on survival cir cuits.  Much is known \nabout the survival cir  cuits that underly defensive, feeding, drinking, \nand sexual be hav iors. When a particular survival circuit is activated, a \nglobal organismic state  of a particular type occurs. We consciously ex -\nperience these as feelings of fear, hunger, thirst, or sexual desire, but \nneurobiologically they merely exist as non-conscious states that con -\ntribute to particular survival situations.

It detects and responds \nto danger. For the same reason, I use the expression Pavlovian threat \nconditioning  instead of  the more traditional expression Pavlovian fear \nconditioning.  I  will elaborate on  these ideas in Part\u00a0V .\nThough seemingly unnatural, Pavlovian threat conditioning is an \nexcellent way to model danger in the wild.

In  future encounters with the condi -\ntioned stimulus, defensive be hav iors and supporting cardiovascular \nchanges are elicited before the dangerous stimulus  causes harm.\nMajor components of  the defensive survival cir  cuit, as revealed in \nrodent studies (and confirmed in lower vertebrates, birds, monkeys, and \n humans) are depicted in Figure\u00a013.1. Although the amygdala is a key \ncomponent, the overall cir  cuit involves much more than the amygdala. \nSpecies- typical threat stimuli are transmitted from sensory receptors in \nthe eyes, ears, or nose to sensory areas of  the thalamus and neocortex. \n These then connect with the amygdala cir  cuit. The lateral amygdala, \nthe sensory gateway, detects the danger signified by the threatening \nstimulus and connects with the central amygdala. The central amyg -\ndala then activates hypothalamic and brainstem networks that separately \nunleash both the muscle contractions that constitute defensive be hav ior, \nespecially freezing, and the supporting visceral responses. The visceral \nresponses provide metabolic support to the defensive be hav iors, both \nin preparation for and during the response, and to restore homeostasis \nwhen the threat level decreases. If  the animal is wounded during the \nencounter, visceral activities facilitate recuperation and healing. While \nthe amygdala is crucial for threat conditioning, plasticity in other fore -\nbrain areas, including sensory areas, also influences the efficiency with \nwhich the defensive be hav ior is controlled by the defensive survival \ncircuit. In addition, though not shown in the figure, areas of  the meso-  \ncortical prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus also contribute.\nAll vertebrates have an amygdala and use its defensive survival \nfunctions to cope with danger. According to recent findings, the \namygdala is an invertebrate chordate  invention that vertebrates in -\nherited. Although protostome invertebrates like flies do not have \nan amygdala, they have their own defensive survival cir  cuits for \ndealing with the dangers in their lives.

The cat became \nvery animated, making random movements. Over time the cat \nlearned, through trial and error, that when it behaved in a par  tic-\nu lar way, the door would open. From that point on, the animal re -\npeated the be hav ior when it was again in that situation. Thorndike \ncalled  these instrumental be hav iors  because they achieved something \nfor the organism\u2014 they provided some degree of mastery over an \nenvironmental situation.\nLike Pavlovian associative conditioning of reflexes and species- \ntypical action patterns, habits are automatically elicited by stimuli. \nBut the two pro cesses also differ. Pavlovian conditioning is about \nhow a reinforcer (like food) enables a novel stimulus (for example, \na tone) to control an innate response (to approach and consume the \nfood). Habit learning, instead, involves acquiring a new be hav ior \n(such as learning how to open a locked door so that food can be \napproached and consumed). And in terms of learning, Pavlovian \nconditioning involves stimulus- stimulus associations (between a neu -\ntral sensory stimulus and a reinforcer), while in habits the rein -\nforcer establishes stimulus- response associations.\nThe stamping-in of a stimulus- response habit requires integration \nin the brain of information about the stimulus situation with infor -\nmation about the response. In all vertebrates, from fish to  humans, \nthe key stimulus- response convergence takes place in the basal gan -\nglia, which, as I noted  earlier, is a collection of subcortical ce re bral \nnuclei that play an impor  tant role in the control of movements.\nThe basal ganglia are reciprocally connected with cortical areas, \nincluding the sensory and motor cortex, which provide it with stim -\nulus and response information.

When the cat was again in that (or \na similar) stimulus situation, the habitual response was automati -\ncally elicited.\nAs mentioned  earlier, it has been proposed that instrumental \nlearning evolved in the Cambrian era by modifying the dopamine \nregulation of locomotor cir  cuits in area- restricted foraging, and by \nintegrating this mechanism with associative learning. Indeed, it is \nknown that animals learn habitual responses as they move around \nin search of food. When food is found in a par  tic u lar location, stimuli \nthat identify that location are stamped in by the payoff. But being \nable to find that location again requires some understanding of  the \nrelationship of  that location to other locations in the foraging area.\nAlthough MacLean had made the hippocampus the centerpiece \nof his emotional limbic system,  these days the hippocampus is known \nfor its role in creating spatial maps of  the environment, remembering \nthem, and using them in foraging. In par  tic u lar, the hippocampus is \nconnected with sensory areas of  the neocortex and the dorsal lateral \nstriatal habit cir  cuit, and, from vertebrates\u2019 earliest days,  these areas \nhave been involved in stimulus- response learning during foraging.\nHabits may seem  simple, but they are not. Leading habit re -\nsearchers, such as Bernard Balleine, Trevor Robbins, Barry Everitt, and \nAnn Graybiel have argued that the final be hav ior that results from \nhabit learning is a concatenation or grouping of diverse component \nresponses, so-called action chunks, that reflect the behavioral history \nof trial- and- error learning that stamped in the habit.\nSomewhat like learned skills (typing, gymnastics, playing a musical \ninstrument), habits are motor responses that are acquired through \nrepetition, and that impart mastery. The chunked action sequences \nof habits in fact are a very impor  tant part of learned skills. But  there \nis a key difference.

He argued that complex be hav iors in animals or  humans \ncannot be accounted for by mere chains of associations.

He also pointed out that much of  the \nunder lying pro cessing takes place unconsciously. This helped set the \nstage for a new science of mind, a cognitive psy chol ogy, that was not \nsolely about consciousness. Lashley additionally noted that language \nmust be factored into the explanation of  human be hav ior, implying \nthat  there are limits to what can be learned from animals.\nMeanwhile in Canada, Donald Hebb, a professor at McGill Uni -\nversity, published in 1949 the influential book The Organ ization of \nBe hav ior,  which broke with behaviorism. Hebb had trained with \nLashley, and also believed that psychological pro cesses like percep -\ntion, memory, thinking, and volition could not be explained by \nstimulus- response habits.

B.\u00a0F . Skinner, in true behaviorist \nform, said that  children acquire language by the differential rein -\nforcement of verbal be hav ior,  much like other animals learn their be-\nhav iors. The linguist Noam Chomsky, by contrast, argued that \nlanguage emerges from an internal  mental structure, a generative \ngrammar that is unique to  humans and that underlies all  human \nmentation. Around the same time  Jerome Bruner published a book \ncalled The Study of Thinking.  He argued that concept formation \noccurs not by way of strings of associations, but instead as a  mental \npro cess.\nAlso in the 1950s, around the same time as surgery on HM, the \npsycholinguist George Miller, who had leaned  toward behaviorism \nearly in his  career, offered another significant challenge to stimulus-  \nresponse psy chol ogy. This tran spired in a famous paper on short- \nterm memory titled \u201cThe Magic Number Seven, Plus or Minus \nT wo: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Pro cessing Information.\u201d \nIn it, Miller showed that  people can hold in mind  (that is, in short- \nterm memory) roughly seven items in the pro cess of  thinking and \nreasoning about the world. This was radical  because behaviorists \ntalked about learning, not memory. Miller went on to suggest that \nthe fixed  mental limit of short- term memory is easily circumvented \nby cognitive strategies such as chunking,  in which information is bun -\ndled or grouped by recoding the information. For example, a typ -\nical phone number in the United States is ten digits long. It is easier \nto remember such a number by separating the ten items into three \ngroups (area code, exchange, and number).

The demise of  behaviorism, he asserted, was an in -\nevitable consequence of  Watson\u2019s founding manifesto that treated \n human and non- human animals as interchangeable in psycholog -\nical research.

It was about non- \nconscious pro cesses that contribute to cognition.\nIn line with Lashley, cognitive psychologists in the 1960s and \n1970s generally assumed that  people lack introspective access to \nthe cognitive pro cesses that underlie conscious thoughts.

And it cannot \ndo this without long- term memory, and especially schema.\nThe contribution of long- term memory to working memory was \nnicely described by Steven Kosslyn, who said that working memory \nfunctions \u201crequire not only some form of  temporary storage, but \nalso an interplay between information that is stored temporarily and \na larger body of stored knowledge.\u201d This body of stored knowledge \nis called semantic memory. We use working- memory executive \nfunctions to retrieve semantic memories as we try to understand sit -\nuations and make decisions about them.\nSemantic memories are about facts, such as what apples are, or \nwhere Italy is located in the world. By interacting as schema, they \nhelp us meaningfully conceptualize and categorize the objects and \nsituations in which we find ourselves. Semantic memories also un -\nderlie the flexible use of language to express meanings non- literally, \nsuch as when we combine concepts to communicate meta phor ically. \nScience, art,  music, religion, politics, society, and culture are based \non factual and conceptual semantic knowledge.\nThe Dual- System / Dual- Process Approach  \nto  Human Cognition\nCon temporary cognitive theories often draw on the difference be -\ntween intuitions and deliberations.

It also \nlearns associations. Kahneman\u2019s System 2, by contrast, allocates at -\ntention to activities that require  mental work, and its functions are \nclosely associated with agency, choice, concentration, and conscious \nexperience.\nA defining feature of System 2 deliberation is that it depends on \nworking memory. Unlike intuition, it uses the deliberative powers \nof working memory to explore alternative decisions and actions. \nThe downside is that deliberation is computationally and energeti -\ncally expensive. System 1 is more efficient, but the energy involved \nin System 2 activities allows you to purposively or deliberatively \npursue your goals.\nDual- system views have been around for a while.

But the lingering effects of  behaviorism delayed animal \nresearchers from joining the cognitive party. While new research was \ncontinuing to support the idea that cognition contributed to asso -\nciative learning in non- human primates and rodents,  these results \n were often quickly followed by studies showing that a stimulus-  \nresponse explanation was just as good or better. Consequently, many \nanimal psychologists remained committed to behaviorist princi  ples \nand continued to reject the idea that some animals in some circum -\nstances are cognitive creatures that pursue goals.\nIn the late 1970s T olman\u2019s ideas  were dusted off and put in the \nspotlight by  John O\u2019Keefe and Lynn Nadel in their book The Hip -\npocampus as a Cognitive Map.  It built on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s observation that \nneurons in the hippocampus, a region of limbic allocortex, fired ac -\ntion potentials as rats explored a novel environment and formed \nmemories about it. The firing patterns of  the cells seemed to re -\nflect the construction of an internal spatial map of  the environ -\nment\u2014in other words, the hippocampus was acting like the brain\u2019s \nGPS. O\u2019Keefe shared the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Med -\nicine for this pioneering work.\nEven evidence for spatial maps in the brain did not convince \nhardcore behaviorists. The Cambridge psychologist Anthony Dick -\ninson characterized the situation in terms of a methodological stum -\nbling block, noting that it is extremely difficult to distinguish from \nthe mere observation of  be hav ior  whether an animal is responding \nhabitually or in a goal- directed way, since the be hav ior looks more \nor less the same for both. The challenge, then, was to design labo -\nratory tests that could distinguish goal- directed be hav ior from \nstimulus- response habits.\nOne of   these tests, by Dickinson and Bernard Balleine, involved \na procedure called reinforcer re- valuation.

For example, he noted that the mental- model theory \nassumes that the more information one needs to make an infer -\nence, the more difficult it should be to draw that inference.

Consequently, inferences based on  mental models \ncan be very useful, but also faulty.\nAs an example of how  mental models contribute to reasoning, \nconsider the assertion \u201cAll artists are bakers.\u201d  Johnson- Laird pointed \nout that this assertion implies the existence of a  mental model rep -\nresenting the relation between the two sets of individuals.

Spe -\ncifically, model-based cognition may have evolved as a way to obtain \nthe fuel required for their high metabolic rates.\nBut endothermy does not guarantee model-based cognition, \nsince all birds are endothermic but only some have model-based \ncognition. A few non-mammalian vertebrates, and even a few pro -\ntostome invertebrates, are endothermic in a situational sense but \ndo not have the continuous full-body metabolic endothermy that \nmammals and birds have.\nIn an adult  human, the brain accounts for only about 2\u00a0  percent \nof total body weight, but 20\u00a0  percent of oxygen use at rest.

These creatures foraged \nwithin small areas close to their home base. This was due to their \n limited visual capacities, nocturnal lifestyle, and dependence on ol -\nfactory cues that decay over short distances. In novel territories, they \nrelied on specific sensory cues (innate or conditioned stimuli) for \nidentifying and evaluating food sources and assessing risks. In other \nwords, like their lower vertebrate ancestors, they used model- free \nbe hav iors in such situations. Also like their vertebrate ancestors, with \nrepeated visits to an area, they could store memories of  the spatial \nlayout and landmarks that signify food or danger. But in contrast to \nlower vertebrates, they  were able to use a  mental model of  the terri -\ntory and its landmarks to store and retrieve memories of past payoffs. \nThis allowed them to evaluate and make predictions about the prob -\nability, risk, and energy cost of procuring food in relation to their \ncurrent needs and expectations about the  future.\nAbout 55 million years ago, primates diverged from the small in -\nsectivore mammals that had survived the climatic change that killed \noff the dinosaurs. The first primates, prosimians (examples  today are \nbush babies and lemurs), made their living in the tree branches of  \nthe rain forest, where they  were protected from carnivorous, ground-  \nforaging mammals.

Specifically, \nthe food required to supply their high energy needs in the forests \nwas becoming scarce due to global cooling. Slowly, their vision im -\nproved.

As  these capacities evolved, they  were able to shift to \na diurnal (daytime) lifestyle, engaging in terrestrial foraging over \nlarge areas that covered thousands of hectares (for reference, four \nthousand hectares is about twelve square miles).  Just as prosimians \n were manual foragers, monkeys  were visual foragers.\n Under the pressures of  wide- range foraging, monkeys acquired \nthe ability to remember the layout of complex expansive foraging \nterritories and the visual features of landmarks that signified loca -\ntions where useful and harmful circumstances  were encountered.

Killing large animals and fighting off competitive carni -\nvores was aided by the invention of stone tools, such as axes, around \nthree million years ago. By 1.5 million years ago, fire was controlled \nand food, especially meat, began to be cooked.\nIn emphasizing the role of foraging in the evolution of cogni -\ntion, I have focused on how ecological  factors, such as scarcity and \nrisk in finding food,  shaped the development of mammalian cogni -\ntion. Another set of impor  tant  factors that influenced cognitive \nevolution in  humans was social in nature, and included coopera -\ntion, communication and language, theory of mind (the ability to \nmake assumptions about the minds of  others based on knowledge \nabout how one\u2019s own mind works), and cultural transmission of \nknowledge.\nFor example, having a theory of mind may have allowed hunters \nseparated in space to create  mental models in which they could \nanticipate what each was likely to do as the hunt progressed, and \nverbal communication would have allowed the day\u2019s successes and \nfailures to be shared and stored as memories that could be incorpo -\nrated into the  mental model of  the hunt and enhance the proba -\nbility of success on the next excursion. By the same token, foraging \nenhancements, such as tool use, likely led to efficiencies in finding \nfood, which may have made more time available for social sharing of \ninformation and social bonding in less transactional ways.\nThis is not to say that social  factors had no effect on other pri -\nmates.

The phi los o pher Peter Godfrey- Smith argues that com -\nplicated  mental pro cesses occur in animals without speech. This is \nobviously correct, but not the point. Daniel Dennett nailed it by \nsaying that while language is not necessary for cognition, cognition \nwithout language is not the same as cognition with it. Language, \nDennett said, creates tracks on which thoughts can travel. Birds make \nsounds to warn of danger or attract mates. Monkeys and apes have \nsounds for diff  er ent predators (cats versus hawks, for example). But \nonly  humans flexibly indicate  things about the pre sent, past, and / or \n future by using syntax to convey to other  humans exactly when and \nwhere a par  tic u lar kind of predator was seen  today, and then to dis -\ncuss the implications with  others so as to make a plan for how to \nact in the  future.\nLanguage is the ultimate multimodal system\u2014it allows you to \nknow that an apple on your kitchen  table, a picture of an apple in \na magazine, the letters A, P , P , L, and E in print or hand script, the \nsound of  the spoken word apple,  and the taste or smell of an apple \nall refer to the same  thing.

Thomas Suddendorf offers this example: \u201cA \nprisoner serving a life sentence for a crime committed in the heat \nof the moment, for instance, may think to himself: \u2018for the rest of my \nlife (level 5), I  will look back on my past (level 4) and regret the \nfact that I failed to anticipate (level 3) that I would regret my past \ndecision (level 2) to commit that crime instead of not committing \nthe crime (level 1).\u2019 \u201d Y oung  children and non- human primates seem \nto manage only a single level. Corballis explains that recursion is \nalso necessary for imagining what  others are thinking. He argues \nthat other animals can perceive, think, know, and feel, but do not \nhave the ability to recursively perceive, think, know, and feel what \n others are perceiving, thinking, knowing, and feeling.

One of  the key forebrain \nchanges in mammals may, therefore, have been the splitting of  the \ndorsal striatum to include separate lateral and medial parts.

This segregation is what allows \nmammals to behave rigidly, with habits, in response to stimuli \nlearned about in the past, or flexibly in a goal- directed fashion in \nnovel situations. Their ability to choose  whether to behave habitu -\nally or flexibly was a tremendous advantage for mammals trying to \nkeep their warm- blooded bodies well fed and regulated, what ever \nthe environmental conditions.\nLike the habit cir  cuit centered on the lateral part of  the dorsal \nstriatum, the goal- directed cir  cuit centered on the medial part is re -\nciprocally connected with sensory and motor areas of  the neocortex \nand receives inputs from midbrain dopamine neurons. But the goal-  \ndirected circuitry is considerably more complex (Figure\u00a019.1).

This suggested a mechanism by which in -\nformation might be held in mind by working- memory pro cesses \nwhile the monkey decides how to respond.\nThe dorsolateral PFC is one component of  the lateral PFC,  which \nalso includes the ventrolateral PFC. It is now known that both of  \n these areas contribute to working memory. A third component of  \nthe lateral PFC is the lateral orbital PFC, which contributes to \nworking memory in tasks where the value of  the stimulus is an \nimpor  tant  factor. T o keep  things  simple, I  will mostly use the broader \nterm lateral PFC, rather than the specific subarea terms, when de -\nscribing the working memory mechanism.\nThe contribution of  the lateral PFC to working memory in de -\nlayed response tasks is illuminated by the fact that it receives inputs \nfrom sensory areas of  the neocortex. For example, the visual cortex \nconnects with the lateral PFC via two pathways. One connects the \nvisual cortex to temporal lobe cir  cuits that support object recogni -\ntion, and the other connects it to the parietal lobe cir  cuits that un -\nderlie the control of action in relation to external space.  These two \nvisual streams converge in the lateral PFC and help bind distinct \nfeatures (what and where) into complex perceptions that then con -\ntrol actions.\nThe lateral PFC integrates sensory information not only within \na single modality, but also between modalities (Figure\u00a019.3). It is \ntherefore referred to as a convergence zone  that can form modality- \nindependent repre sen ta tions and allows a monkey or  human to \n\u201cknow\u201d what something is by the way it looks, smells, sounds, feels \nand / or tastes.

This led Bradley \nPostle to suggest that working memory is not simply localized to \nthe lateral PFC, but instead involves a co ali tion of areas that are con -\ntrolled by executive functions of  the lateral PFC. Postle summa -\nrized several specific kinds of interactions between the lateral PFC \nand other areas that underlie decision- making during the delay pe -\nriod, including monitoring, attending, selecting information, and \nevaluating expectations about needs, desires, and goals.\nEarl Miller and colleagues have evaluated the cellular basis of such \npro cesses, and showed that neurons in specific cell layers of  the lat -\neral granular PFC exercise top- down executive control over poste -\nrior sensory and memory pro cess, regulating their se lection for entry \ninto working memory.\nNote that the lateral PFC is not the exclusive home of executive \nfunctions such as attention.

This cannot be done without some \ntemporary storage mechanism that allows integration across special -\nized systems.\nBaddeley suggested a solution to this prob  lem, proposing the ex -\nistence of an episodic buffer\u2014 a limited- capacity temporary storage \nsystem that might bind diverse kinds of  temporarily stored infor -\nmation from subsidiary systems to form a single repre sen ta tion that \ncould then be stored in one\u2019s episodic long- term memory.  Later \nstudies found that unimodal features are often bound together in \nunimodal systems, whereas the more complex repre sen ta tions in -\nvolving multiple modalities are bound in a way consistent with the \nepisodic buffer hypothesis.\nThe neural basis of Baddeley\u2019s episodic buffer is not well under -\nstood.

He describes this quality as a phenomenal \nfeeling \u2014 the  thing that makes red seem red, and fear feel fearful. \nTherefore conscious states feel like something, whereas unconscious \nstates are accompanied by no such feeling. But why do conscious \n mental states have this signature phenomenal feeling? David Chal-\nmers, another phi los o pher, has dubbed this question the \u201chard \nprob lem\u201d of consciousness. Phi los o phers like Nagel and Chal mers, \nboth of  whom are colleagues of mine at NYU, refer to such feel -\nings as qualia.  Neither believes that consciousness can be explained \nscientifically. Chal mers accepts that the brain is necessary for expe -\nrience, but believes that how that happens  will forever remain a mys -\ntery. Owen Flanagan has dubbed him a \u201cnew mysterian,\u201d referring \nto an older dualist tradition that viewed consciousness as dependent \non mysterious, non- physical laws.\nScientists have learned quite a bit from phi los o phers about how \nto conceptualize complex aspects of  the mind for the purpose of \nguiding research.

Given this, the goal was to find a new kind of physics \nthat would allow one\u2019s soul to persist as a physical entity  after death, \nand at the time of  the resurrection be re united with its body.

While both ideas \nare scientifically dubious, even if  we assume they are correct, \u201cplea-\nsure\u201d and \u201clove\u201d are still what is being discussed.\nThat said, I think that the Churchlands\u2019 approach is dead-on when \nit comes to behavioral control pro cesses of  the mere neurobiological \nrealm\u2014 that is, model- free neural pro cesses that control reflexes, \nfixed action patterns, Pavlovian- conditioned responses, and stimulus-  \nresponse habits.

The solution \nis to use mental- state words only when referring to  mental states, \nand to use non- subjective state (behaviorist) language for behav -\nioral control pro cesses that are correlated with, but do not depend \non, conscious  mental states. This is why I say the amygdala cir  cuits \nthat control freezing to danger are not fear cir  cuits. They are defen -\nsive survival cir  cuits. The  mental state of fear is what happens when \nyou consciously realize that you are in danger.\nNow this does not mean that the  mental state is not neural.

Mental state con -\nsciousness obviously depends on creature consciousness\u2014 you  can\u2019t \nbe conscious of  mental states if you are not alive.\nThe use of  the same word, consciousness, for being alive and re -\nsponsive to stimuli and for awareness of  mental states, is problem -\natic, especially since the modifier creature  or  mental state  is often \nomitted. Indeed, in some scientific circles, consciousness is auto -\nmatically assumed to mean being alive and responsive, and in  others \nit is assumed to mean  mental awareness. This can lead to confusion \nfor  those not familiar with the difference. So, to be clear,  mental \nstate consciousness is the focus  here.\n Mental State Consciousness\nA variety of  mental state theories of consciousness have been pro -\nposed by phi los o phers and / or scientists. I  will limit the discussion to \nthree broad classes of such theories: first- order, higher- order, and \nglobal workspace theories. I emphasize  these  because they have been \nstudied and discussed extensively, and  because most other theories \nare typically understood as falling within  these frameworks.  Because \nmost research and theorizing about  these and other theories of con -\nsciousness have been aimed at sensory, especially visual, conscious -\nness, much of  the discussion about the brain mechanisms of  mental \nstate consciousness has been focused on the relation between the vi -\nsual cortex and the PFC, especially granular areas of  the lateral PFC.\nFirst- order theory  (FOT)  is the most basic and the easiest to de -\nscribe. Theorists from this school argue that you consciously see an \napple when a repre sen ta tion of  the apple in the world is con -\nstructed by your visual cortex.

In HOT, a subjective visual experience about the external \nworld occurs when visual cortex repre sen ta tions are further pro-\ncessed cognitively by the PFC. This additional pro cessing is often \ndescribed as cognitive re- representation, or re- description. Ac -\ncording to HOT, this re- representation / re- description is said to be \ncrucial for the conscious experience of external events. David \nRosenthal, a leading proponent of HOT in philosophy, identified \ntransitivity  as a key feature of higher- order experience. According \nto this princi ple, if one is not aware of  being in a state of inner \nawareness about a stimulus, then one is not having a conscious \nexperience of  that stimulus. Another impor  tant feature of most \nversions of HOT is that the higher- order cognitive state is not \nitself consciously experienced. It is instead a pre- conscious re-  \nrepresentation / re- description that allows the first- order state to be \nexperienced.

Lau\u2019s theory, \ncalled perceptual real ity monitoring,  proposes that consciousness is \njointly determined by first- order and higher- order states. In his model, \nthe higher- order state implicitly indexes or points to the relevant first- \norder sensory information, and distinguishes between sensory states \nthat are real and  those that are imaginary or hallucinated. Indexing, in \nthis use, is a kind of sparse low- level re- description that minimizes the \nneed for the higher- order state to have rich content. A related sparse \nPFC coding view is Stephen Fleming\u2019s higher- order state space (HOSS) \ntheory,  which proposes that the brain uses implicit inferences based on \nbeliefs about learned first- order perceptual repre sen ta tions of  the world \nto construct higher- order states.  These two sparse theories bear some \nrelation to the more general notion that concepts are implicit semantic \npointers.\nAxel Cleeremans\u2019s version of HOT is called the self- organizing \nmetarepre sen ta tional  theory. It proposes that consciousness depends on \nrich higher- order pro cessing based on previous learning drawn from \nlower- order states.  Because the learning involved can be rather  simple \nand automatic, he emphasizes the term \u201cre- description\u201d rather than, or \nin addition to, re- representation as a pro cess under lying higher- order \nstates. Cleeremans suggests that the universal availability of informa -\ntion in the global workspace is a consequence of   these learned higher- \norder re- descriptions.\nRichard Brown\u2019s higher- order repre sen ta tion of a repre sen ta tion \n(HOROR)  theory , unlike all of  the  others mentioned, minimizes the \nessentiality of first- order states\u2014 a view supported by findings showing \nthat following damage to the visual cortex one can have a conscious \nvisual experience in the absence of a first- order state. Similar to Rosen -\nthal\u2019s foundational HOT, and unlike most other higher- order theorists, \nBrown emphasizes rich pro cessing based in part on rich memory. But \nin contrast to Rosenthal, who argues that the higher- order state allows \nconscious awareness of  the first- order state, Brown proposes that the \nhigher- order state itself constitutes the experience.

This question came to the fore in the 1990s through the writ -\nings of Francis Crick and Christof Koch. Noting that pro  gress in \nunderstanding consciousness was stalled, they suggested that  because \nso much was known about the visual system, a focus on visual aware -\nness might be a useful strategy for making headway.\nFrom existing lit er a ture, Crick and Koch proposed that connec -\ntions between the visual cortex and the PFC (by which they meant \nthe lateral, granular PFC) might be impor  tant. Specifically, they \nargued that  because the PFC receives input from the late stages of \nvisual pro cessing, but not from the early stages,  people are conscious \nonly of visual information received from the late visual stages.\nAlthough the idea that the PFC is impor  tant for consciousness \nwas not novel, Crick\u2019s fame from his role in the discovery of DNA \nmeant that it grabbed the attention of phi los o phers, psychologists, \nneuroscientists, biologists, mathematical modelers, physicists, and the \npress. The Crick and Koch papers, in short, jump- started con-\ntemporary enthusiasm for scientific studies of visual consciousness. \nThe fact is, since the late nineteenth  century, consciousness research \nhas mostly focused on vision, and for precisely the reason that Crick \nand Koch identified.

For example, when visual stimuli \nare made consciously imperceptible by subliminal, brief flashes of \nimages, participants typically fail to report seeing anything, whereas \nwith somewhat longer pre sen ta tions they can report what they saw. \nAnd if  the brain is imaged during the stimulus pre sen ta tions, when \nthe participants can accurately report on the stimulus the visual \ncortex and the lateral PFC are both activated, but when they cannot \nreport, only the visual cortex is active.\nSuch findings clearly show that activity in the lateral PFC is cor -\nrelated with conscious experience. Proponents of first- order theo -\nries say that such correlations merely demonstrate cognitive access \nto the conscious first- order state. But other studies, using a proce -\ndure called transcranial magnetic stimulation  to briefly alter activity in \nthe lateral PFC during the visual pre sen ta tions, show that the par -\nticipant\u2019s ability to report on what was seen is disrupted, suggesting \na causal role for PFC.\nRethinking the Sensory- Centric Approach\nThe sensory- centric view of consciousness has certainly been a pro -\nductive research focus. But it has had two negative consequences. \nFirst, the field got stuck on the idea that the solution to conscious -\nness in the brain was to be found in pro cessing loops between the \nvisual cortex and lateral PFC. And second, most of  the research fo -\ncused on awareness of  simple sensory stimuli, such as the color, \nbrightness, shape, or direction of movement of lines, dots, or patches \nof light. Such basic stimuli offer technical advantages for precise, \nquantifiable studies of  the relation between physical features of \nstimuli and conscious experiences of   those features.

Supporting the idea of  the involvement of  the PFC in conscious -\nness are findings showing that increased functional activity in the PFC \nis correlated with conscious experiences, as well as with per for mance \non meta- cognitive tasks that are thought to be related to conscious -\nness. While  these correlations are suggestive, they do not directly im -\nplicate the PFC in consciousness. But results of other studies do. For \nexample,  people with PFC damage have impairments in consciousness \nand a decline in per for mance on meta- cognitive tasks related to con -\nscious experience. While first- order theorists have challenged  these \nconclusions, their challenges overlook impor tant nuances.\nThe PFC pro cesses information consciously and non- consciously. \nTherefore, one cannot assume that a state is conscious just  because \nit depends on the PFC. At the same time, just  because PFC damage \nfails to result in a mea sur able loss of conscious awareness does not \nmean that the PFC is not involved in the conscious experience. For \nexample, damage to the PFC may alter consciousness in subtle ways \nwithout necessarily eliminating it. And much depends on how that \nloss is assessed.  Whether patients with PFC damage are conscious in \nthe same way they  were prior to the damage may not be revealed by \nstandard clinical exams, which are relatively crude compared to rig -\norous scientific tests.

For example, you can learn \nsemantic facts about Greece by reading a travel book while sitting \nat home preparing for a trip  there. But it is quite another  thing to \nexperience the culture on your own. When you do, you form mem -\nories that have specific content. And when retrieved, they include \na place stamp about where you  were, a time stamp about when you \n were  there, and an event stamp about what you saw and did and who \nyou  were with. Where, when, and what are essential components \nof so- called episodic memories.\nWhen Endel Tulving first proposed the distinction between se -\nmantic and episodic memory in the early 1970s, he treated  these \nas truly dif fer ent kinds of states. Current understanding holds \nthat while semantic memories can occur separately from episodic \nmemories, episodic memories always include relevant semantic infor -\nmation. But  there is a unique ele ment of distinctiveness to episodic \nmemories\u2014 they alone allow you to construct a sense of personal \nidentity and continuity in your life.\nMartin Conway has discussed some key defining features of epi -\nsodic memory, which I liberally paraphrase  here.  Every moment in \nwaking life is an episode, but memories of most episodes are quickly \nforgotten  unless they are especially meaningful to you.

He referred to  these as noetic \nand autonoetic  consciousness.\nNoetic states of consciousness have  mental content based on se -\nmantic facts and conceptions about the world. They often involve \nschema, which, as  we\u2019ve seen, provide conceptual templates that give \nmeaning to the objects and situations we encounter in life. States of \nautonoetic  consciousness, by contrast, have episodic  mental content in \nwhich \u201cyou\u201d are the entity that had the experience. Tulving there -\nfore proposed that the two kinds of consciousness  were associated \nwith distinct kinds of knowledge. Noetic states, he said, come with \nfactual (including conceptual) knowledge, while autonoetic states \ncome with personal knowledge about who you are.\nPerhaps the most celebrated feature of autonoetic consciousness \nis  mental time travel.  When Locke said that, through memory, we \nknow we are the same person  today as in the past, he was, in effect, \nreferring to the ability to engage in  mental time travel. Similarly, \nwhen William  James wrote, \u201cMemory requires more than mere \ndating of a fact. It must be dated in my past,\u201d he too had something \nlike  mental time travel in mind.\nIn addition to allowing you to construct episodes from your life\u2019s \npast, episodic autonoetic consciousness allows you to mentally expe -\nrience the pre sent, and to imagine pos si ble situations that may occur \nin your  future life. Paraphrasing the neuroscientist Gy\u00f6rgy Buzs\u00e1ki, \nepisodic memory functions like a search engine that we use to con -\nstruct the past, pre sent, and  future.

This refers to a situation \nin which one is, for example, unable to recall someone\u2019s name but \nis confident that they know it. T ypically, an entire complex of in -\nformation about the person can be explic itly known (their age, hair \ncolor, ethnicity, personality traits, and so on), despite the inability \nto come up with their name. Zolt\u00e1n Dienes has obtained scientific \nsupport for the idea that  people can be confident of knowing that \nthey know something (it feels familiar) but without knowing what \nor how they know it.\nConsistent with this line of  thought, Asher Koriat has referred \nto such vague fringe feelings as sheer subjective experiences.   These, he \nsaid, depend on implicit inferences  shaped by unconscious pro cesses \nthat monitor memory states and yield a pre sent or absent conclu -\nsion, rather than the specific content that you feel you know. This \nunconscious monitoring of memory has been called procedural or \nimplicit meta- cognition. Stephen Fleming has recently made a similar \npoint\u2014 that being able to report on  whether something is pre sent \nor absent is diff  er ent than being able to report about one\u2019s awareness \nof the item in question.\nWhy does consciousness have a dual organ ization consisting of \na tacit fringe component and an explicit focal condition? Mangan \nexplains this situation as a tradeoff. Through working memory, \nstimuli can be selected and attended to in focal consciousness, and \nresult in articulatable (introspectable and reportable) content. Fringe \nstates accompany explicit conscious states and imbue them with a \nfeeling of familiarity and rightness, but in  doing so make minimal \ndemands on working memory and articulation resources.

But in order for this \nhigher- order account of anoesis to work, we have to explain how \nprocedural meta- cognition based on procedural memory can be the \nbasis for a kind of consciousness, since both are generally viewed as \nbeing unconscious. Given the diversity of unconscious pro cesses, \n there is certainly room for diff  er ent kinds to vary in just how un -\nconscious they are.

As William  James and  others have pointed out, \n\u201cthe feeling of an absence is diff  er ent from the absence of a feeling.\u201d\nOther evidence comes from states of depersonalization, such as \nin psychosis, or when one is  under the influence of psychedelic sub -\nstances. For example, Kalina Christoff and colleagues note that one \ncan feel like a bystander, watching the body responses and  mental \nstates of another person, when in such a state. Of par  tic u lar interest, \nChristoff\u2019s team identified a functional disconnection in such states \nbetween the meso- cortical PFC component of  the default mode \nnetwork (involved in body and  mental state owner  ship) and the me -\ndial frontal pole (involved in cognitive pro cesses that underlie one\u2019s \ninner narration of  who one is). Importantly, the effects on owner-\nship preceded the cognitive effects. This is consistent with the pos -\nsibility that tacit anoetic awareness of owner  ship typically adds \nfeelings of rightness to momentary explicit noetic and autonoetic \nawareness. This dissociation highlights the importance of keeping \nseparate the sub- granular meso- cortical areas and granular neocor -\ntical areas in the medial wall of  the hemi sphere.\nIt is impor  tant to distinguish between conditions where one\u2019s \nbody does not feel right from situations where the rightness of \nowner  ship is lost. For example, if you are nauseous, have a head -\nache, are dizzy, or other wise feel sick, your body does not feel right. \nSimilarly, if you are depressed, your body can feel tired and / or \nheavy. But  these feelings of  wrongness about the body come with \ncontent- dependent explicit awareness about one\u2019s body states. In \nother words, in  these situations anoesis, noesis, and autonoesis are \ninteracting properly. But when body and / or  mental owner  ship is \nlost, Christoff and colleagues argue that  there is a breakdown in the \ncoupling of anoesis to explicit conscious states.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2334, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "131ecef4-e9e1-48a1-9cf6-5f113ce3a6c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "131ecef4-e9e1-48a1-9cf6-5f113ce3a6c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "261", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/LeDou/Joseph E.

If   these cognitive states refer to noetic \nand autonoetic states of consciousness, we would have an account \nof how meta- cognitive representation / re- description of deep-  \nprocedural learning provides the unconscious context that under -\nlies fringe anoetic feelings. Anoesis, in other words, may, as implied \n earlier, be the elixir that makes your noetic and autonoetic experi -\nences feel right\u2014 that makes red feel like red, and fear feel like fear.\nBut what exactly is being re- represented / re- described in ano -\nesis? Hakwan Lau and I proposed that for modality- specific noetic \nperceptual experiences, the re- representation / re- descriptions \nunder lying anoesis typically involve the activity of  the sensory cir-\ncuits that are presently engaged in perception.  Because deeply \nlearned activity of a certain type has routinely occurred in some set \nof  these sensory cir  cuits during similar situations in the past, the kind \nof sensory activity pre sent now helps make the pre sent experience \nfeel familiar.

Also required is that the lower- order \nsensory information be re- represented / re- described via procedural \nmeta- cognition, which brings anoesis into the higher- order PFC \n mental model.\nMore recently, Lau and I, in collaboration with Matthias Michel \nand Steve Fleming, elaborated on the idea that procedural learning \nby cir  cuits within and between the sensory cortex and the PFC \nunderlie the subjective experience of sameness (familiarity). Put in \nthe context of  the pre sent discussion, anoetic states give explicit con -\nscious experience a feeling of rightness via tacit comparison to other \nrelated experiences in a higher- order subjective quality space,  but only when \nre- represented / re- described via implicit meta- cognition.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2278, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f51b399a-932f-4a90-93fe-57e5c1cf6064": {"__data__": {"id_": "f51b399a-932f-4a90-93fe-57e5c1cf6064", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "263", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/LeDou/Joseph E.

There -\nfore, in higher- order theory, the noetic experience of an apple feels \nright, regardless of   whether it is of a light or a very intense shade of \nred, if the pre sent hues have been part of  the experiences that taught \nyour visual and prefrontal cortex, via recurrent connections between \nthem, what red is to you.\nObviously, visual features other than color must also match past \nlearning in order for the noetic experience of  what seems to be an \napple to feel right.

A theory of consciousness that cannot account for emo -\ntions is hardly a theory of consciousness. I  will explain how emotions \nemerge in my multi- state hierarchal higher order theory as autonoetic \nstates of consciousness.\nCir cuits involving the amygdala, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal \ngray area together are often considered a mammalian fear cir  cuit. By \ncontrast, I argue that  these constitute a defensive survival cir  cuit that \nhas ancient roots in vertebrate history. The defensive survival cir  cuit \ncontrols behavioral and physiological responses that co- occur with fear, \nand feedback from  these responses serve as signals that contribute to \nthe feeling of fear. But the defensive survival cir  cuit is not itself respon -\nsible for the feeling.\nThe feeling of fear, in my view, is an autonoetic experience that re -\nsults from the cognitive interpretation that you are in a situation of \ndanger based on the presence of a stimulus that you have, from semantic \nor episodic experience, come to know of as dangerous. The interpreta -\ntion is conceptualized by momentarily active schema, including schema \nabout danger and fear (emotion schema), but also schema about you \nand your relation to danger and fear (self- schema), all filtered through \nyour culture\u2019s understanding of fear and danger (cultural schema). \nThe core of  the experience results from the meta- cognitive repre  sen-\nta tion\u2009/\u2009description of  the active schema in the granular PFC working-  \nmemory  mental model.

But even in adults, \nthe non- conscious under pinnings of emotions are not always precise \nenough to produce an experience that is clearly identified with a common \nemotion word.

We agree that for explicit autonoetic fear \nin  humans, anoetic experiences are in the background, overshadowed \nby the more prominent cognitive- based experiences. The main difer -\nence in our views is that for me, cortical re- representation\u2009/\u2009re- description \nby sub- granular, meso- cortical PFC is required for anoetic fringe feel -\nings of fear.

He became less vocal about his theory , and \nheld back on publishing it  until he could make a stronger case.\nIn 1859, more than twenty years  after the exchange with Wedg -\nwood, he published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natu ral Se-\nlection; or, The Preservation of Favored Races in the Strug gle for Life.

The other features are mere be -\nhavioral correlates of consciousness in  humans. It would certainly \nbe useful to assess  these correlates in diff  er ent animals, so long as \nthe results are not used as hard evidence for consciousness.\nI have been working on a diff  er ent empirically based approach \nfor understanding what  mental state consciousness might be like in \nother mammals. I start by considering the brain mechanisms of an -\noetic, noetic, and autonoetic consciousness in  humans. This then \nprovides a way to reverse engineer what kind or kinds of conscious -\nness might be pre sent in diff  er ent mammals, given anatomical simi -\nlarities and differences between their brain and ours.\nFor example, sub- granular meso- cortical PFC areas are shared by \nall mammals. Therefore, what ever kind of consciousness  these areas \nenable in  humans may also be pre sent, at least to some extent, in \nnon- human primates and in non- primate mammals. Since all an -\nthropoid primates (monkeys, apes, and  humans) have granular areas \nof PFC, but other mammals do not, what ever roles that granular \nPFC areas play in  human consciousness may also be pre sent in some \nform in other primates, but would be lacking in non- primate mam -\nmals.  Because early evolving primates (that is, prosimians and tar -\nsiers) have only the primitive beginnings of granular PFC, their \nconscious capacities, if  they have them, likely fall between what \nmonkeys and non- primate mammals possess. Fi nally, contributions \nof human- unique areas of granular PFC, especially within the frontal \npole, would be lacking in other primates (except possibly some other \n great apes) and other mammals.

But lack of clarity about what \n\u201csentience\u201d actually means makes the claims difficult to evaluate.\nThe simplest definition of sentience is the sheer ability to respond \nto sensory stimuli. As I noted  earlier, a paper by Merker is often \ncited as evidence for sentience in animals. But in using responsive -\nness to sensory stimuli as the criterion, Merker only showed instances \nof creature consciousness (the condition of  being alive and respon -\nsive to sensory stimuli). What most who use the term sentience are \ntrying to get at is the possibility that sensory-motor responsiveness \ndemonstrates that animals have the phenomenal feeling of  what it is \nlike to be conscious, something we  humans assume, from our experi -\nences, that we possess. But mental state consciousness cannot be \ndemonstrated by mea  sur ing sensory responsiveness.  Others point to \nthe ability of animals to engage in complex activities such as prob  lem \nsolving to make the case.

But first-order theories of \nhuman consciousness (see Chapter 21) are non-cognitive mental state \ntheories. While I believe that a higher-order explanation is required \nfor complex human experiences, it is possible that autonoesis and \nnoesis not only overshadow anoesis, but also obscure primitive under -\nlying non-cognitive mental states in us. I don\u2019t subscribe to this idea, \nbut neither do I completely rule out this possibility. If sentience and \nfirst-order mental states turn out to be one and the same in humans, \nit would open the door for first-order sentience having a long evolu -\ntionary history. But unless first-order sentience can be shown to exist in \nhumans by differentiating it from both anoesis and creature conscious -\nness, it will remain a vague notion that lacks clear scientific grounding \nas a kind of primitive conscious state.\nMy intent in discussing sentience was not to suggest a solution to \nwhat it is, but to illustrate where it might fit within the conceptual \nframework I have built in this book. I believe that if speculations \nabout sentience and other forms of consciousness in non-human \nanimals were more openly acknowledged as speculations, rather than \ntreated explicitly or implicitly as facts that are so obvious, so intui -\ntively correct, that they must be true, the work would be more \nwidely respected and impactful.

The sleep researcher Allan Hobson has argued that dreaming \nis a potent, naturally occurring form of narrative / confabulation, \nnot unlike hallucinations in schizo phre nia.\nAccording to Lisa Bortolotti, \u201c People who confabulate know \nwhat their attitudes and choices are, but do not have access to key \ninformation about the formation of   those.\u201d \u00d6rulv and Hyd\u00e9n iden -\ntified several problem- solving functions of confabulations: sense- \nmaking to understand the pre sent; self- making to maintain personal \nidentity; and world- making to or ga nize interactions with the outer \nworld. One way to think about all this is that confabulations are \ncalled on when ordinary narrations are insufficient to sustain a  \nJamesian feeling of rightness.\nHealthy  people use episodic memory to construct narratives that \nconnect ele ments of  thoughts about events into a coherent under -\nstanding of  who one is and why they do what they do. This is dra -\nmatically illustrated by reflections from a patient who,  because of  \nbrain damage, temporarily lost episodic memory and the ability to \ncreate narrations, including confabulations: \u201cI did not have the \nability to think about the  future\u2014to worry, to anticipate or per -\nceive it. . . .

He could remember, and narrate, only  those events that \nhad occurred in the previous thirty seconds.\nAbsent inner narrations, our understanding of our own folk psy -\nchological mind, and its role in understanding the minds of  others \n(theory of mind), would not exist. As Bruner noted in \u201cLife as Nar -\nrative,\u201d folk psy chol ogy endows the expected and ordinary events \nin life with legitimacy and authority, and when  these beliefs are \n violated or challenged, new narratives are constructed.\nIn The Self Delusion,  Gregory Berns nicely captures the contri -\nbutions of episodic memory to personal narratives:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2156, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6696e357-0102-49d4-887e-f366f5b6f379": {"__data__": {"id_": "6696e357-0102-49d4-887e-f366f5b6f379", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "287", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/LeDou/Joseph E.

Verbal expression \nand conscious experience are, in my scheme, separate, that is, par -\nallel, outputs of a non- conscious  mental model and its non- conscious \nnarrative.\nNarratives Are (or Can Be) Pre- Conscious  \nand A- Modal\nSeveral times in this journey I have mentioned that  every conscious \nstate is preceded by non- conscious pro cessing. But it\u2019s time to be \nmore precise about this. The non- conscious states that precede \nconscious experiences are better termed pre- conscious,  since not all \nnon- conscious states are antecedents of consciousness.\nThe natu ral way to think about inner narratives is in terms of lan -\nguage. For example, the psychologist  Julian Jaynes, in his provoca -\ntive late 1970s book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of  \nthe Bicameral Mind,  proposed that auditory hallucinations of inner \nvoices (narrations)  were a precursor to the evolution of conscious -\nness. Perhaps the voice in your head, the verbal monologue that runs \nthrough your mind, is the narration that underlies conscious expe -\nrience. Support for this is the fact that we can attend to and be \nconscious of  the monologue\u2014in fact, sometimes we  can\u2019t shut it up. \nThe inner monologue, which is, in effect, linguistic mind- wandering, \nhas a role in verbal consciousness.

This idea was challenged in the 1930s by the Rus sian \npsychologist Lev Vygotsky, who gave private speech  a defining role in \nthe mental development of children, and in the  mental well- being of \nadults. Consistent with Vygotsky\u2019s point of view, some psychologists \n today think of private speech as making crucial contributions to the \nemergence in childhood of a subjective sense of  who one is, and to the \ncontinued maintenance of  this personal awareness over time.\nPrivate speech has also been related to working memory and execu -\ntive functions, as well as to theory of mind, and consciousness. Perhaps \nit is not surprising, then, that when private speech is lost as a result of  \nbrain damage, the sense of  who one is suffers.

Additionally, it might be nec -\nessary to  factor in the impact of feedback to the ner  vous system from \nbehavioral responses evolving in response to  these dynamic environ -\nmental conditions at each step along the way.\nEven if all this  were pos si ble, the question that would likely remain \nunanswerable is  whether, to use the now trite expression, \u201c there is \nany \u2018 there\u2019  there.\u201d In other words, would a perfect computer simula -\ntion or robot actually have conscious states of  the kind that developed \nthrough our biological, neurobiological, cognitive, and conscious \nevolution, or would it just be capable of generating a sophisticated set \nof responses that resemble  those a  human would make?\nMy take is that precise implementation in a non-biological physical \nsystem of all the neurobiological and cognitive processes that consti -\ntute what we think of as human consciousness would not be suffi -\ncient. I might be wrong, but as I see things today, human conscious -\nness is only implementable in biological beings with our particular \nevolutionary history.

Writing about such systems, the social scientist Donald \nCampbell noted in 1974 that pro cesses at lower levels of a hierarchy \nare constrained by the workings of  the higher level. Not controlled or \ndetermined by, but instead, constrained by. In the brain, conscious \npro cesses are higher than pre- conscious cognitive pro cesses;  these are \nhigher than other non- cognitive pro cesses that remain isolated from \nconsciousness; and  these, in turn, are higher than mere neurobio -\nlogical pro cesses.\nMike Gazzaniga offered this analogy to help understand how \nneural constraints work: just as cars are constrained by the traffic they \ncreate, the neural pro cesses under lying  mental pro cesses are con -\nstrained by the  mental pro cesses they create. We can unpack this by \nsaying that pro cesses within each of our own unique hierarchical \nrealms of existence depend on and constrain pro cesses lower in the \nhierarchy.
