If  the ultrasound \nexamination is normal, this efectively excludes soft-tissue neoplasia. A reasonable protocol is to perform ultrasound on all palpable \u2018lesions\u2019 to exclude cysts, and on patients without any identifable mass, and to proceed to MRI only when there is a solid or partly solid element to an unidentifable lesion. Tumour vascularity is best assessed by Doppler ultrasound. It can be studied by intravenous gadolinium DTPA-enhanced MRI; however, this is a more expensive and invasive technique, providing no more information than Doppler ultrasound. \nSummary box 8.12 \nImaging of soft-tissue lesions \n\u25cf Ultrasound is the best for screening; it is often the only imaging \nrequired \n\u25cf MRI is best for local staging and follow-up \n\u25cf Doppler ultrasound can assess vascularity cheaply and effectively \n\u25cf Ultrasound is useful for biopsy \nInfection \nIn the early stages of  joint infection, the plain flms may be \nnormal, but they should still be performed to exclude bony erosions in case a painful joint is the frst sign of  an arthropa-thy. Ultrasound examination is the easiest and most accurate method of  assessing joint efusions, although, when an efusion is identifed, it is not possible to discriminate between blood and pus. Aspiration guided by ultrasound is the best method of  making this distinction. MRI may be required to assess early articular cartilage and bone inv olvement. \nRadiographs should also be used to examine patients with \nsuspected osteomyelitis. Although they may not detect early infection, they will demonstrate or exclude bony destruction, calcifcation and sequestrum formation. CT may be needed to giv e a cross-sectional view, in order to assess the extent of \nbony sequestrum. \n(a) (b) \nFigure 8.25 Coronal T1- (a) \nand axial T2-weighted fat-suppressed (b) images \nthrough the distal femur of the patient in Figure 8.24 illustrates the bony area involved, the soft-tissue extent of the tumour and the \nrelationship of the neurovas-cular structures to the mass (arrows). \nMRI is perhaps the most sensitive method for detect-\ning early disease and is the preferred technique to defne \nthe activity and extent of  infection, as it shows not only the bony involvement but also the extent of  oedema and soft-tis-sue involvement (Figure 8.26 ). Abscesses may be detected or \nexcluded, and subperiosteal oedema is readily visible. MRI can be used as a staging procedure to plan treatment, including surgical intervention. Serial examinations can be used to follow the response to intravenous antibiotics and are very useful in the management of complex osteomyelitis. In cases of negative \nor equivocal MRI, nuclear medicine techniques such as bone scintigraphy can be very sensitive, and specialised studies using tracers such as gallium citrate or indium-labelled white cells increase specifcity. \nSummary box 8.13 \nImaging of potentially infected bone and joint \n\u25cf Plain radiographs may be needed to exclude bone erosion \n\u25cf Ultrasound is sensitive for an effusion, periosteal collections \nand superfcial abscesses and can be used for guided aspiration \n\u25cf CT is useful in established infection to look for sequestrum \n\u25cf MRI is useful to defne the activity of osteomyelitis, early infection and soft-tissue collections \n\u25cf Bone scans are sensitive but of low specifcity \n\u25cf Complex nuclear medicine studies are useful in negative MR examinations or equivocal cases \nMetabolic bone disease \nPlain radiographs should be the frst images of  patients with \nmetabolic bone disease.

IMAGING IN MAJOR TRAUMA \nIntroduction \nTrauma remains a major cause of  mortality and morbidity in all age groups. Presented with a multiply injured patient, rapid and efective investigation and treatment are required to maxi-mise the chances of  survival and to reduce morbidity.

At no point should imaging delay the treatment of  immediately life-threatening injuries. As in other settings, the quickest and least invasive examinations should be performed frst. A radiologist present in the trauma room at the time of  patient assessment is able to evaluate the radiographs rapidly, relay this information back to the team and guide further imaging, which may include further plain flms, CT , ultrasound and MRI. \nPlain radiographs \nConventional radiography allows rapid assessment of  the major injuries and can be carried out in the trauma room while the patient is clinically assessed and treated. Despite the time constraints, the number of  staf involved and the restricted mobility of the patient, high-quality images can be routinely obtained with due care and attention. Increasingly plain flms are being replaced by whole-body CT . In many centres CT scanners are immediately available in the emergency depart-ment and indeed in some departments patients are assessed and treated on the scanning table. \nThere is no routine set of  radiographs to be obtained, and \nthe decision is based on the mechanism of injury, the stability of  the patient\u2019s condition and w hether the patient is intubated. \nThe most commonly performed initial radiographs are a chest \nradiograph, a single anteroposterior view of  the pelvis and a cervical spine series. \nThe supine chest radiograph should encompass an area \nfrom the lung apices to the costophrenic recesses and include the ribs laterally. Chest radiographs give valuable information in both blunt and penetrating trauma. Evaluation of  the radio-\ngraph should be undertaken in a systematic manner to mini-mise the chances of  missing an injury. In the frst instance, the position of  lines and tubes, including the endotracheal tube, should be assessed, followed by assessment of  the central air -\nways. Following this, the lungs should be evaluated for abnormal focal ar eas of  opacifcation, which may represent aspiration, \nhaemorrhage, haematoma or oedema, as well as more difuse opacifca tion refecting a pleural collection. Alternatively, rel-\native focal or unilateral lucency may refect a pneumothorax in the supine position. Evaluation of  the mediastinum should include its position, which may be altered by tension pneumo-thoraces or large collections, as well as its contour, an alter -\nation of  w hich may refect a mediastinal haematoma due to \naortic or spinal injury. Finally, the skeleton and the soft tissue should be carefully examined for rib, vertebral, scapular and limb fractures, as well as evidence of  surgical emphysema and paraspinal haematomas ( Figure 8.27). \nPelvic radiographs are also commonly performed to screen \nfor, and assess, fractures of  the bony pelvis. The image should include the iliac crests in their totality and extend inferiorly to below the lesser trochanters. When assessing the flm, the align -\nment of  the sacroiliac joints and the symphysis pubis should be carefully examined, as some fractures, especially those of  the sacral arcades, can be very subtle on the pelvic radiograph. The presence of pubic fractur es raises the possibility of ure-\nthral injury and should alert clinicians to exercise caution with bladder catheterisation (Figure 8.28). \nThe utility of  cervical spine x-rays depends on the con-\nsciousness level of  the patient and the presence of  distracting injuries. In fully conscious patients with an isolated neck injury, clinical assessment can be used to guide the need for x-rays. In patients with distracting injuries and/or altered consciousness, including intubated patients, CT is preferr ed (Figure 8.29). \nFurther radiographs of  the thoracic and lumbar spine \nand the peripheral skeleton may be required, depending on the clinical setting.

In addition, there appears to be a break in the posterior arch of C1 (arrow). Computed tomography of the cervical spine (b) demonstrates a fracture of the anterior arch as well \nas the posterior ar ch of C1 (arrow). \nperpendicular views are required for adequate assessment. \nHowever, with the increasing use of  CT in assessment of  the torso the need for plain flms is diminishing. \nRadiographs of  the skull or facial bones have no role in the \nimmediate assessment of  the multitrauma individual, except for immediate localisation of  a penetrating object. \nUltrasound \nUltrasound has an evolving role in the assessment of  acutely traumatised patients. The main current roles of  ultra-sound include the assessment of  intraperitoneal fuid and haemopericardium (focused assessment with sonography for trauma [FAST]), the evaluation of pneumothoraces in supine \npatients and in guiding intervention. \nFAST ultrasound is a limited examination directed to look \nfor intraperitoneal fuid or pericardial injury as a marker of \nunderlying injury. T his avoids the invasiveness of  diagnostic \nperitoneal lavage. In the presence of  free intraperitoneal fuid and an unstable patient, the ultrasound allows the trauma sur -\ngeon to explore the abdomen as a cause of blood loss. In the presence of fuid and a haemodynamically stable individual, \nfurther assessment by way of  CT can be performed. Howe ver, \nit is important to realise that ultrasound has limitations in the identifcation of  free fuid. This includes obscuration of  fuid by bowel gas or extensive surgical emphysema. More organ-ised haematoma may be more difcult to visualise. It must also be emphasised that the principal role of  ultrasound is not to identify the primary solid organ injury, although this may be \nvisualised. Occasionally, a second ultrasound scan may show free fuid in the presence of  an initially nega tive FAST scan. \nThe detection of  a pneumothorax on a supine radiograph \ncan be very difcult. Ultrasound examination may be used to identify a radiographically occult pneumothorax. With a \nhigh-resolution linear probe, the pleura can be visualised as an ec hogenic stripe, and its motion with respiration can also \nbe assessed. In the presence of  a pneumothorax, the sliding motion of  the pleura is lost. Ultrasound may also be used to detect a haemothorax or haemopericardium. \nFinally, ultrasound may be of  value in guiding the place-\nment of  an intravascular line by direct visualisation of  the ves-sels. This can be especially advantageous in shocked patients. \nComputed tomography \nCT is the main imaging method for the investigation of  intra-cranial and intra-abdominal injuries and vertebral fractures. With current multidetector scanners a comprehensive exam-ination of  the head, spine, chest, abdomen and pelvis can be completed in less than 5 minutes. Traditionally the CT scanner was referred to as \u2018the doughnut of  death\u2019, as imaging could lead to delays in emergency treatment.

The position of  chest drains can be identifed, allowing adjust-ment\u00a0 of  position if  necessary. Abdominal and pelvic CT is usually undertaken as an extension to the chest CT . If  an abdominal examination is performed, the pelvis should be \nincluded to avoid missing pelvic injuries and fr ee pelvic fuid. \nCT is an excellent means of identifying hepatic, splenic (Figure 8.32) and renal injuries. Delayed examination after the administration of  intravenous contrast agents allows assessment of  the pelvicalyceal system in cases of  renal trauma. Pancreatic and duodenal injuries may also be identifed, but detection of  these injuries may be more prob lematic. Using \nCT , the accuracy of detection of bowel or mesenteric injuries is less than it is for solid organ injury, and these injuries should be suspected when there is free intraperitoneal fuid without an identifable cause (Figure 8.33). Close clinical follow-up \nand early repeat scanning with oral contrast can often reveal the bowel or mesenteric injury in patients with free fuid with no other cause identifed. \nThe image data may be reconstructed into thinner slices \nfor the diagnosis of  injuries to the thoracic and lumbar spine and for the better delineation of  pelvic and acetabular frac-tures. Complex intra-articular fractures of  the peripheral skel-eton, such as calcaneal and tibial plateau fractures , may be \nusefully examined by dedicated thin-section studies provided \nthis does not delay the treatment of  other more serious injuries (Figure 8.34). CT angiography may be used to demonstrate \nvascular injuries in the limbs in those with penetrating injuries or complex displaced fractures. \nMagnetic resonance imaging \nThe value of  immediate MRI in trauma is relatively limited and is largely confned to the imaging of  spinal injuries (Figure 8.35)\n. \nAccess to urgent MRI is not widely available, and there are \nmajor practical problems in imaging patients who require ven-tilation or monitoring. MRI is therefore only practical in stable patients. All monitoring equipment must be MRI compatible, and ventilation support should be undertaken by staf skilled and experienced in these techniques as applied to the MRI environment. MRI may be used to diagnose injuries of  the spinal cor d and associated perispinal haematomas in patients \nwith neurological signs or symptoms. MRI can supplement CT in spinal injuries by imaging soft-tissue injuries to the longitudi-nal and interspinous ligaments. MRI is mandatory in patients in whom there is facetal dislocation if  surgical reduction is being considered, to minimise the risk of displacing soft-tissue or disc material into the spinal canal during r eduction proce-\ndures. Subtle fractures may be difcult to identify, particularly if they are old, but an acute injury is normally identifed b y the \nsurrounding oedema. Bony abnormalities should be reviewed using CT as fracture lines are hard to identify with MRI and unstable injuries may be overlooked. In the less acute setting, MRI may also be used to assess difuse axonal injuries, with an accuracy exceeding CT . \nVascular interventional radiology \nWith the development and refnement of  CT angiography techniques, the diagnostic role of  formal angiography has become limited.

IMAGING IN ABDOMINAL SURGERY \nThe acute abdomen \nThe term \u2018acute abdomen\u2019 encompasses many diverse entities. \nIMAGING IN COMMON SURGICAL \nCLINICAL SCENARIOS \nIn this section the roles of  diferent radiological modalities in \ncommon surgical scenarios are discussed, with a brief  rationale behind their use and typical appearances of  various patholog-ical processes. \nBowel obstruction \nThe plain abdominal radiograph is a useful tool in diagnosing bowel obstruction. Small bowel obstruction can generally be distinguished from large bowel obstruction by virtue of  the following: the small bowel lies centrally in the abdomen while the large bowel lies peripherally; the valvulae conniventes (folds) of  the small bowel traverse the entire width of  the lumen while the haustra of  the large bowel do not; and the calibre of  the small bowel is typically less than the large, even when obstructed (typical measurements in obstruction: small bowel 3.5\u20135\u00a0cm, large bowel 5\u20138\u00a0cm). \nHowever, it must be stressed that a normal plain radio-\ngraph does not exclude an obstruction \u2013 if  there is persistent concern, further imaging is indicated; CT is the modality of choice, having largely superseded the contrast follow-through or enema, particular ly in the acute setting. The key to diagnosis \nof  a mechanical obstruction of  either small or large bowel on CT , and diferentiation from paralytic ileus, is identifcation of  a transition zone from dilated proximal bowel to collapsed distal bowel. In small bowel obstruction if  no obvious cause such as a mass, volvulus or intussusception is identifed, then the most likely aetiology is adhesional. There is no need to give oral contrast for a suspected bowel obstruction CT as fuid in the lumen is a natural contrast agent and, in any case, oral con-trast may well not reach the point of  obstruction by the time of the scan. CT is also invaluable to diagnose complications of bowel obstruction suc h as perforation and ischaemia. If  there \nis ongoing uncertainty after CT as to whether the diagnosis is mechanical obstruction or a paralytic ileus, delayed plain abdominal radiographs obtained 1 and 4 hours after ingestion of  dilute Gastrografn (typically 75\u00a0 mL Gastrografn mixed with 75\u00a0mL water) can be useful to assess if  contrast reaches the colon. Gastrografn also has an osmotic efect that can, on occasion, be therapeutic\n. \nClosed loop obstruction, where the bowel is obstructed \nat two points, often in close proximity to each other and fre-quently related to an internal hernia or adhesional band, is a particular type of  small bowel obstruction prone to developing ischaemia. It should be suspected at CT if  the bowel is dilated \ndistal to a transition point with a further transition point more \ndistally (Figure 8.36).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3784, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5be58fcf-cba8-4aa0-bae0-18a0635135c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "5be58fcf-cba8-4aa0-bae0-18a0635135c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07", "entities": ["BASIC"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fae98b01-7853-45ae-afe9-345b2666c955", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07"}, "hash": "41d1a880329223196cda940a7c222dcba91c3cf3aabe707d4e4e8d47490ad4d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Imaging in common surgical clinical scenarios 137 \nPART 1 | BASIC PRINCIPLES\n01_08_B&L28_Pt1_Ch08_4th.indd  13701_08_B&L28_Pt1_Ch08_4th.indd  137 31/08/2022  10:2031/08/2022  10:20  \n \nFigure 8.36 Coronal computed tomography showing a failed renal \ntransplant in the right iliac fossa and second transplant in the left iliac fossa.

Caution must also be exercised in interpreting any free air in the context of  recent abdominal surgery, as postoperative air can persist for up to 5\u20137 days in the peritoneal cavity. \nIf  the erect CXR is equivocal or a possible walled-of per -\nforation is suspected, a CT is the optimal modality, which may show tiny quantities of  free air but may also show the cause, e.g. peptic ulcer, diverticulitis or a neoplastic lesion.

Intravenous contrast administration is essential to look for thrombus/embolus in the mesenteric vessels, though ischaemia due to low-fow states can still occur in their absence. Ischaemia can be a difcult diagnosis to make radiologically but is suspected, in the appropriate clinical context, by bowel wall thickening, submucosal oedema and free fuid between the folds of  the mesentery (particularly if haemorrhagic). Ischaemia must be strongly suspected if  these fndings are seen in association with a closed loop obstruction or strangulated hernia. Ischaemic colitis typically afects the \u2018watershed area\u2019, which is the junction of  the areas supplied by the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries, typically in the region of  the splenic fexure. \nWhen bowel wall ischaemia proceeds to transmural infarc-\ntion, the diagnosis is usually more straightforward with evi-dence of  pneumatosis (air in the bowel wall) typically identifed. The air in the bowel wall can then track into mesenteric veins and thence to the portal vein, a CT sign of  grave prognostic signifcance in an adult as it implies widespread and relatively \nlongstanding bowel infarction. \nGastrointestinal haemorrhage \nThe aetiology of  acute gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage varies between the upper GIT (common causes including peptic ulcer disease, varices and Mallory\u2013Weiss tears) and the lower GIT (common causes including angiodysplasia, diverticular haemorrhage and neoplastic lesions). While endoscopy is a useful frst-line investigation for both, in refrac-tory or occult GI haemorrhage radiology can also contribute to diagnosis and management. Nuclear medicine scans using radioisotope-labelled red blood cells are useful when bleeding is intermittent, but for patients suspected of  active bleeding the best investigation is a CT mesenteric angiog ram. Non-contrast \nscans to look for bright blood in the bowel lumen should be supplemented with scans in the arterial phase to assess for a blush due to active extravasation and the portal venous phase to optimise detection of  wall thickening and masses and to look for sites of  venous bleeding. If  non-invasive imaging is efective, catheter angiography can be used to embolise a bleeding point. \nIn\ufb02ammatory processes \nAppendicitis \nHistorically, a straightforward clinical diagnosis of  appendicitis obviated any need for imaging, but with the proven accuracy of available modalities imaging has become increasingly popular to reduce negative appendicectomy rates and to make alternative diagnoses. While a plain radiograph may demonstrate a calcifed appendicolith in the right iliac fossa, it is insufciently sensitive or specifc to be reliable. In children, who typically have a fav ourable body habitus, ultrasound is \nthe best test as it reduces radiation exposure. This also applies to females of  childbearing age, again to reduce radiation exposure, but also because the symptoms may be mimicked by gynaecological pathology, such as ectopic pregnancy, haem-orrhagic ovarian cyst and tubo-ovarian abscess, all diagnoses that are best made with ultrasound.

While some \nauthors have promoted the use of  focused ultrasound for this indication, in general it is best diagnosed with a CT scan.

Complications of  diverticulitis include perforation, abscess formation, fstulation to adjacent structures and strictures in the bowel. CT is also the modality of  choice to identify these; as with appendicitis, it can be used to guide percutaneous abscess drainage as a bridge to defnitive surgery. after ingestion of  an agent such as lactulose or mannitol to distend the small bowel. The other obvious advantage of  MRI is the lack of  radiation, which is particularly relevant in young patients with Cr ohn\u2019s disease, who often undergo multiple \nimaging studies over their lifetime; for this reason it is gaining in popularity for infammatory bowel disease follow-up. \nAn acute fare-up may also require imaging, and an ultra-\nsound is usually a good frst test to look for dilated bowel loops and any abscess, though CT may ultimately be required as gas-flled bowel loops can obscure visualisation of an abscess \non ultrasound. MRI is the imaging modality of  choice to assess perianal fstulae and abscesses. \nInfammatory bowel disease \nThe diagnosis of infammatory bowel disease is made histo-logically. Radiologically, the diagnosis and monitoring of infammatory bowel disease has changed signifcantly in recent years. Previously a barium study of  the small bowel, either a follow-through (where barium is ingested orally) or enteroclysis \n(where dilute barium is infused via a nasojejunal tube) was used as a screening tool if  symptoms are vague. If  the diagnosis of  Crohn\u2019s disease is established, barium studies can still be useful to demonstrate the extent of  disease, particularly to demonstrate the length and number of  strictures if  surgery is planned. Increasingly, however, the role of  barium studies has been superseded by cross-sectional imaging, particularly MRI enterography, which entails an abdominopelvic MRI scan \nFigure 8.40 Coronal computed tomography reformatted images \nshowing a diverticular perforation.

As a second-line investigation CT is also accurate for this condition, demonstrating similar signs of gallbladder distension and wall thickening with surrounding infammatory changes. CT is also useful to diagnose complica-tions such as gangrenous cholecystitis, gallbladder perforation and emphysematous cholecystitis, which may necessitate emergency cholecystectomy. If  cross-sectional studies are equivocal, he patobiliary scintigraphy can be useful, with the \ndiagnosis of  acute cholecystitis suggested by non-visualisation of  the gallbladder 3 hours after radioisotope administration. \nA frequent limitation of  ultrasound is failure to visualise \nthe common bile duct throughout its length owing to overlying bowel gas, and elective cholecystectomy was typically accom-\npanied by bile duct imaging or exploration to look for duct calculi. Increasingly, however, MRCP has been shown to be highly accurate in excluding bile duct calculi before surger y. \nUltrasound is also a useful frst-line investigation for jaun-\ndice of  unknown cause as it can demonstrate duct dilatation and gallstones. If  a defnitive cause is not shown with ultra-sound, or a mass is identifed but its precise nature and extent is uncertain, CT is indicated to look for common causes, includ-ing stones, c holangiocarcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma. CT \ncan not only identify malignant lesions but also demonstrate the extent of  local infltration, including the ver y important assess-\nment of  vascular involvement if  surgery is consider ed, and the \npresence of metastases to determine potential resectability. If \nthe ducts are of  normal calibre in a jaundiced patient, liver biopsy should be consider ed. \nRenal colic \nThe historical methods of  imaging for renal colic all have their limitations. Plain flm radiography may not demonstrate all calculi, will not show renal tract obstruction and is unreliable for alternative diagnoses. IVU necessitates the administration of  intravenous contrast and, if  a level of  obstruction is sought, delayed flms up to 8 hours after injection may be required; it also will not provide alternative diagnoses. Ultrasound will demonstrate hydronephrosis and hydroureter, and calculi in the kidneys and either the proximal or distal ureters can usually be identifed as echogenic foci with posterior acoustic shadowing; however, the ureter from just below the kidneys to the pelvis is usually obscured by bowel gas, which signifcantly impairs stone detection. \nFor these reasons the optimal investigation is now CT of \nthe kidneys, ureters and bladder, a non-contrast, low-dose (2\u20133\u00a0MSv if a low mA scan is perf ormed, equivalent to the dose \nfrom a limited IVU series) scan from the upper poles of  the kidneys to the pubic symphysis. Contrast administration, either orally or intravenously, is not employed as it does not aid stone detection and may even impair it. Stones are readily identifed as high-attenuation (typically calcifc) foci, and the secondary signs of  acute ureteric obstruction may also be seen, includ-ing hydronephrosis and hydroureter, renal enlargement and perinephric fat stranding. The most common sites for stones to be seen are at the areas of  ureteric narrowing, namely the \npelviureteric junction, the pelvic brim and vesicour eteric junc-\ntion. CT also ofers unrivalled capability for making alternative diagnoses when compared with other modalities.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm \nIf  a pulsatile mass is felt in the abdomen and the diagnosis of  a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is suspected, ultrasound is a useful modality; provided the aorta is not obscured by bowel gas, an aneurysm can usually reliably be excluded. If, however, ultrasound visualisation is suboptimal and the diagnosis is as a result equivocal, or if  an aneurysm is identifed and information regarding the extent and exact size is required, for example for surgical or endovascular repair planning, CT angiography is indicated, with the aorta typically scanned from the arch to the pubic symphysis in the arterial phase after intravenous contrast.

The development of  stage-dependent treatment protocols involving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and preoperative radiotherapy relies on the \nability of  imaging to determine stage accurately before surgical and pathological staging. The importance of  accurate cancer staging is refected in the central role of  the radiologist in most MDT meetings\n. \nOnce a diagnosis of  cancer has been established, often by \npercutaneous or endoscopic biopsy, new imaging techniques can considerably improve the ability to defne the extent of tumour, although the pathological specimen remains the \u2018gold standard\u2019. Many staging systems are based on the tumour\u2013 node\u2013metastasis (TNM) classifcation. \nTumour \nIn most published studies, cross-sectional imaging techniques (CT , ultrasound, MRI) are more accurate in staging advanced (T3, T4) than early (T1, T2) diseases, and the staging of  early disease remains a challenge. In gut tumours, endoscopic ultra-sound is more accurate than CT or MRI in the local staging of  early disease (T1, T2) by virtue of  its ability to demonstrate \nthe layered structure of  the bowel wall and the depth of tumour penetra tion (Figure 8.41).

A size criterion of  8\u201310\u00a0mm is often adopted, but it is not usually possible to distinguish benign reactive nodes from infltrated nodes. This is a particular problem in patients with intrathoracic neoplasms, in whom enlarged benign reactive mediastinal nodes are common. The echo characteristics of  nodes at endoscopic ultrasound have been used in many centres to increase the accuracy of  nodal staging, and nodal sampling is possible via either mediastinoscopy or transoesoph-ageal biopsy under endoscopic ultrasound control. PET/CT is of increasing use in detecting nodal metastases from a wide \nrange of  malignancies, with the capacity to co-register the area of  increased FDG uptake with a precise anatomical location. Novel MRI contrast agents may help in the identifcation of \nnon-enlarged tumour-infltrated nodes. \nMetastases \nThe demonstration of  metastatic disease will usually signif-cantly afect surgical management. Modern cross-sectional imaging has greatly improved the detection of  metastases, but occult lesions will be overlooked in between 10% and 30% of patients. CT is the most sensitive tec hnique for the detection of \nlung deposits, although the decision to perform CT will depend on the site of the primary tumour, its likelihood of intra-pulmonary spread and the efect on staging and subsequent therapy of  the demonstration of  intrapulmonary deposits. \nUltrasound and CT are most frequently used to detect liver \nmetastases. Contrast-enhanced CT can detect most lesions greater than 1\u00a0 cm, although accuracy rates vary with the \ntechnique used and range from 70% to 90%. Recent studies suggest that MRI may be more accurate than CT in demon-strating metastatic disease. Preoperative identifcation of  the segment of  the liver involved can be determined by translation \nof the segmental surgical anatomy, as defned by Couinaud, to \nthe cross-sectional CT images \n(Figure 8.42 ). \nThe technique of PET/CT with FDG, an analogue of glu-\ncose, is becoming a powerful tool in oncological imaging. This functional and anatomical imaging technique refects tumour metabolism and allows the detection of  otherwise occult metas-tases. The most common indications for PET/CT have been staging of  lymphoma, lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer , and preoperative assessment of potentially resect-\nable liver metastases, such as colorectal carcinoma metastases \n(Figure 8.43 ). \nIntraoperative ultrasound is an additional method of \nstaging that provides superb high-resolution imaging of  sub-centimetre liver nodules that may not be palpable at surgery. This is often used immediately prior to resection of  liver metastases. \nClaude Couinaud, 1922\u20132008, French surgeon and anatomist, described the segmental anatomy of  the liver in his seminal book Le Foie: \u00c9tudes anatomiques et \nchirurgicales.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3465, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f58dc1f-6c9b-4974-b59e-63f936f22e24": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f58dc1f-6c9b-4974-b59e-63f936f22e24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07", "entities": ["Couinaud"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f9b100b-c83c-4c5d-8fd7-52bc1cd7e670", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07"}, "hash": "5889128342de6b0e8408926ac269617100770a08918f195c0f2925682e0b0a39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "01_08_B&L28_Pt1_Ch08_4th.indd  14201_08_B&L28_Pt1_Ch08_4th.indd  142 31/08/2022  10:2031/08/2022  10:20  \n   \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n CHAPTER 8 Diagnostic imaging PART 1 | BASIC PRINCIPLES \n142 \nIVC \nLHVRHV \nVII VIII MHV \nVI V \nIV II \nIII \nLT \nLT \n(a) \n(c) (b) \n(d) \nIVb IVa \nIII IIVIII \nVII \nV \nVI I \nI \nFigure 8.42 (a) Surgical lobes of the liver (after Couinaud).

In addi-tion, a complex enteric nervous system has evolved to control its function and communicate with the central and peripheral nervous systems. Finally, as the gastrointestinal tract contains the largest sources of  foreign antigens to which the body is exposed, it houses well-developed arms of both the innate \nand acquired immune systems. Therefore, it is not surprising that malfunction or infection of  this complex organ results in a wide spectrum of  pathology. However, its importance in disease pathogenesis is matched only by its inaccessibility to traditional examination. \nFew discoveries in medicine have contributed more to \nthe practice of  gastroenterology than the development of diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy. Although spectacular advances in radiology have occurr ed recently with the intro-\nduction of  multislice spiral computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the ability to take tar -\ngeted mucosal biopsies remains a unique strength of  endos-copy. Historically , radiological techniques were required to \nimage areas of jejunum and ileum inaccessible to the stan-\ndard endoscope; ho wever, the introduction of both capsule \nendoscopy and single-/double-balloon enteroscopy allows \nboth diagnostic and therapeutic access to the entire gastro-\nintestinal tract. Image enhancement with techniques such as chromoendoscopy, magnifca tion endoscopy and narrow band \nimaging allows increased resolution a t the mucosal level and \nincreases diagnostic yield. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can examine all layers of the intestinal wall as well as extraintestinal structures. Finally, experimental techniques such as confocal \u2022 The indications for diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic \nprocedures including endoscopic ultrasound \n\u2022 The recognition and management of complications \n\u2022 Novel techniques for endoscoping the small bowel \n\u2022 Advances in diagnostic ability \nlaser endomicroscopy give resolution at a level compatible with \nstandard histology. The advances in the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopy lend themselves to disease surveillance for specifc patient groups as well as population screening for gastrointesti-nal malignancy. Likewise, there has been a rapid expansion in the therapeutic capability of endoscopy with both luminal and extraintestinal surgery being performed via endoscopic access. \nAs in all areas of interventional practice, competent \nendoscopists must match a thorough grounding in anatomy and physiology with a clear understanding of  the capabilities and limitations of  the rapidly advancing techniques a vailable. \nPerhaps most importantly they must appreciate all aspects of patient care, including preprocedural management, commu-nication before and during the procedure and the manage-ment of  endoscopic complications. This chapter aims to guide the reader through these areas in addition to introducing the breadth of  procedur es that are currently performed. \nHISTORY OF ENDOSCOPY \nOver the last 50 years, endoscopy has become a powerful diagnostic and therapeutic tool. However, its development required two obvious but formidable barriers to be overcome. First, the gastrointestinal tract is rather long and tortuous and, second, no natural light shines through the available orifces! Therefore, successful visualisation of  anything beyond the distal extremities requires a fexible instrument with an intrinsic light source that can transmit images to the operator. \nThe breakthrough was the discovery that images could \nbe transmitted using fexible quartz fbres. Although this was frst described in the late 1920s, it was not until 1954 that Hopkins built a model of  a fexible fbre imaging device.

In parallel with advances in diagnostic ability, a range of  therapeutic procedures was developed (Table 9.1). Although the fbreoptic endoscope has been the workhorse of many endoscopy units ov er the last three decades, its obsoles-\ncence was guaranteed by the invention of  the charge-coupled device (CCD) in the 1960s, which allowed the creation of  a digital electronic image, permitting endoscopic images to be processed by a computer and transmitted to television screens. Thus, the modern endoscope was born (Figure 9.1). \nFigure 9.1 Photograph of a standard gastroscope and colonoscope. History does not sit still, and endoscopic evolution will con-\ntinue with the replacement of  much diagnostic endoscopy with capsule endoscopy and virtual imaging. Enhanced resolution \nwith high-defnition operating systems, dye and digital chromo-endoscopy and e ven histological-grade images have increased \nthe diagnostic yield of  surveillance procedures. EUS allows \ndiagnosis and therapy to extend beyond the mucosal surface of  the intestine. Endoscopy has become increasingly therapeu-tic and historical divisions betw een medicine, radiology and \nsurgery will become progressively blurred. As the complexity of  the procedures increases, the distinction between special-ist and general endoscopists will become mor e defnite. This \nreinforces the need for all endoscopic practitioners to have a detailed understanding of  the units in which they work and the instruments that they use. \nTHE MODERN ENDOSCOPY UNIT \nOrganisation \nA well-designed endoscopy unit stafed by trained endoscopy nurses and dedicated administrative staf is essential to support good endoscopic practice and training. Clinical governance with regular appraisal and assessment of  performance should be embedded within the unit\u2019s philosophy. Endoscopist train-ing demands particular attention, with a transparent process of skills- and theory-based education centred on practical experi-ence and dedicated training courses. Experienced supervision of  all trainees is essential until competency has been obtained and assessed by an appropriately v alidated technique, such as \ndirect observation of  practical skills (DOPS) and review of \nprocedure logbooks. All endoscopists should record diagnostic and therapeutic procedure numbers and markers of  compe-tency such as colonoscopy completion rates, polyp detection rates, mean sedation use and complication rates.

Dedicated small bowel centres require capsule endoscopy and a single-/double-bal-loon enteroscope for ileojejunal visualisation and therapeutics. Larger centres will require linear and radial EUS, particularly if they specialise in gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary malignancy. An electrosurgical unit is the cornerstone of  many therapeutic \nprocedures, and this may be supplemented by argon plasma coagulation (APC), laser units and radiofrequency ablation for advanced therapeutics. \nInstrument decontamination \nEndoscopes will not withstand steam-based autoclaving and therefore require high-level disinfection between cases to prevent transmission of  infection. Although accessories may be autoclaved, best practice requires the use of  disposable single-use items whenever possible. All equipment should be decontaminated to an identical standard whether for use on immunocompromised/infected patients or not. This process involves two equally important stages: frst, removal of physical debris from the internal and external surfaces of  the instrument and, second, chemical neutralisation of  all microbiological agents. A variety of agents are available and endoscopists should familiarise themselves with the agent in use in their department. In 2020 the British Society of Gastroenterology updated its guidelines for decontamination of endoscopes (see Further reading). Care should be applied to the decontamina-tion of  duodenoscopes because of  reports of  transmission of multiresistant bacteria (Summary box 9.1). deemed to confer a high risk of endoscope contamination. A single quality assured decontamination cy cle is considered \nsufcient, but the endoscope should be decontaminated sep-arately from others with a single-use disinfectant. There is no longer a requirement to quarantine the endoscope pr ovided \nthat routine traceability data can be demonstrated. \nCONSENT IN ENDOSCOPY \nApproximately 1% of  medical negligence claims in the USA relate to the practice of  endoscopy. Many of  these could have been avoided by a careful explanation of  the procedure, including an honest discussion of  the risks and benefts. Therefore, obtaining informed consent is a cornerstone of good endoscopic practice. It preserves a patient\u2019s autonomy, facilitates communication and acts as a shield against future complaints and claims of  malpractice. \nThe most important aspect of  the consent procedure is that \na patient understands the nature, purpose and risk of  a partic-ular procedure, in addition to potential alternatives. Current guidelines w ould suggest that a patient should be informed of \nminor adverse events with a risk of  more than 10% and serious events with an incidence of  more than 0.5%.

The involvement of  anaesthetists to advise on appropriate protocols is recommended. Endoscopy in certain situations (particularly paediatric endoscopy) requires a general anaesthetic\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this should only be undertaken by appropriately trained staf with adequate equipment available. \nSummary box 9.3 \nSedation in endoscopy \n\u25cf Pharyngeal anaesthesia may increase the risk of aspiration in \nmore heavily sedated patients \n\u25cf Comorbidities must be identifed so that sedation can be individualised \n\u25cf All sedated patients require secure intravenous access \n\u25cf Benzodiazepines reach their maximum effect 9\u201320\u00a0minutes after administration\u00a0\u2013\u00a0doses should be titrated carefully, particularly in the elderly or those with comorbidities \n\u25cf Coadministration of opiates and benzodiazepines has a synergistic effect; opiates should be given frst and doses need to be reduced \n\u25cf The use of supplementary oxygen is essential in all sedated patients \n\u25cf Sedated patients require pulse oximetry to monitor oxygen saturation; high-risk patients or those undergoing high-risk procedures also require blood pressure and electrocardiogram monitoring \n\u25cf A trained assistant should be responsible for patient monitoring throughout the procedure \n\u25cf Resuscitation equipment and sedation reversal agents must be readily available \n\u25cf The use of anaesthetic agents such as propofol for complex procedures requires specialist training \n\u25cf The half-life of benzodiazepines is 4\u201324\u00a0hours\u00a0\u2013\u00a0appropriate recovery and monitoring is essential. Postprocedural consultations may not be remembered, and patients must be advised not to drink alcohol or drive for 24\u00a0hours \nENDOSCOPY IN PATIENTS WITH \nDIABETES \nAs approximately 2% of  the population has diabetes, manag-\ning glycaemic control before and after endoscopy is an essential aspect of endoscopic practice. Each unit should develop a policy for managing diabetic control during endoscopy. Factors infuencing management include the type of  diabetes , the \nprocedure that is planned, the preparation/recovery time and the history of  diabetes control in the individual patient. Thus, a patient with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes undergoing colonoscopy will require more input than a patient with type 2 diabetes on oral hypoglycaemic medication under -\ngoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. All patients should bring their own medication to the unit and should be advised not to drive in case there is an alteration in their glycaemic control. Most patients can be managed using clear protocols on an outpatient basis; however , elderly patients and those with \nbrittle control should be admitted. In general, patients with diabetes should be endoscoped frst on the morning list. In complex cases the diabetes team should be involved. ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS \nThe majority of  endoscopies can be performed safely without the need for routine antibiotic prophylaxis. However, given that certain endoscopic procedures are associated with a signifcant bacteraemia (Table 9.2), there are several specifc situations where antibiotic cover is required to prevent either bacterial endocarditis, infection of  surgical prostheses or systemic sepsis. In general, the risk of  infection relates to the level of  bacteraemia and the risk of  the underlying medical condition. Traditionally, patients with a previous history of  endocarditis or a metallic heart valve received antibiotic prophylaxis for all endoscopic procedures, and some national guidelines still refect this. However, in 2009 UK guidelines changed in response to the low reported incidence of  infective endocarditis in this patient group undergoing endoscopy. Patients with severe neutropenia may also require antibiotic prophylaxis for endoscopy. The antibiotic regime used will depend on local guidelines. \nTABLE 9.2 Approximate incidence of bacteraemia \nin immunocompetent individuals following various procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4242, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3d15679-ef83-4d2d-a517-714ad8fcb543": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3d15679-ef83-4d2d-a517-714ad8fcb543", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07", "entities": ["UK"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2488d03e-c860-4a72-b9f8-73992b33d25f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07"}, "hash": "c1a7aa068529686bdc0d5061d090dba7a062c8c86994253bdc1cc0a9960a09b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1bc70b60-4759-4ae5-befc-1ba6d6828406", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07"}, "hash": "c8489ba15f2bf9f287fa958198531bd7155af3bd083c29fa3ed6dc53b336efca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, in 2009 UK guidelines changed in response to the low reported incidence of  infective endocarditis in this patient group undergoing endoscopy.

The key points to remember when managing anticoagulants in patients undergoing endoscopy are given in Summary box\u00a09.4. \nSummary box 9.4 \nManaging anticoagulants in patients undergoing \nendoscopy \nIt is important to recognise and understand: \n\u25cf The risk of complications related to the underlying \ngastrointestinal disease from anticoagulant therapy \n\u25cf The risk of haemorrhage related to an endoscopic procedure in the setting of anticoagulant therapy \n\u25cf The risk of a thromboembolic/ischaemic event related to interruption of anticoagulant therapy \nUrgent endoscopy for gastrointestinal \nbleeding in the anticoagulated patient \nThe risk of  clinically signifcant gastrointestinal bleeding in \npatients on warfarin is increased, particularly in patients with a past history of  similar events, if  the international normalised ratio (INR) is above the therapeutic range or if  the patient is taking concomitant aspirin/non-steroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In these situations, the risk of  reversing the anticoagulation must be weighed against the risk of  ongoing haemorrhage. If  complete reversal is not appropriate, correc-tion of  the INR to approximately 1.5 is usually sufcient to allow endoscopic diagnosis and therapy. Anticoagulation can often be resumed 24 hours after successful endoscopic therapy (Figure 9.2). \nElective endoscopy in patients on \nanticoagulants and antiplatelet agents \nEndoscopic procedures vary in their potential to produce \nsignifcant or uncontrolled bleeding. Diagnostic oesophagogas-troduodenoscopy (OGD), colonoscopy, enteroscopy, diagnostic EUS and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) without sphincterotomy are considered low risk, as is mucosal biopsy. High-risk procedures include polypectomy, endoscopic sphincter otomy, stent placement and procedures \nwith the potential to produce bleeding that is inaccessible or uncontrollable by endoscopic means, such as dilatation of benign or malignant strictures, percutaneous gastrostomy insertion and EUS-guided fne-needle aspiration. Likewise, the probability of a thromboembolic complication during temporary cessation of  anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy depends on the underlying medical condition (Table 9.3). \nTABLE 9.3 The risk of a thromboembolic event varies \naccording to the underlying medical condition. \nCondition Risk \nAtrial fbrillation with valvular heart disease High \nMechanical mitral valve High \nMechanical valve and previous thromboembolic event High \nDeep vein thrombosis Low \nUncomplicated atrial fbrillation Low \nBioprosthetic valve Low \nMechanical aortic valve Low \nAspirin \nAspirin and NSAIDs inhibit platelet cyclo-oxygenase, resulting \nin suppression of  thromboxane A2-induced platelet aggrega-\ntion. Limited published data do not suggest an increased bleed-ing risk in patients taking standard doses and, therefore, there is no need to discontinue therapy before endoscopic procedures. \nUPPER GASTROINTESTINAL \nENDOSCOPY \nOGD is the most commonly performed endoscopic procedure. \nExcellent visualisation of  the oesophagus, gastro-oesophageal junction, stomach, duodenal bulb and second part of  the duodenum can be obtained.

The most common therapeutic endo-scopic procedure performed as an emergency is the control of  upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage of  any aetiology. Band ligation has replaced sclerotherap y in the management \nof oesophageal varices (Figure 9.4), whereas sclerotherapy \nusing thrombin-based glues can be used to control blood loss from gastric and duodenal varices.

A prime example has been improved endoscopic treatment of  Barrett\u2019s high-grade dysplasia and early oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Destruction of residual Barrett\u2019s epithelium in cases of low- \nor high-grade dysplasia is possible with endoscopic ablation, and has been shown to reduce risk of  progression to cancer. The most commonly used technique for this purpose is radio-frequency ablation, where 360\u00b0 ablation can be achieved with a balloon catheter, or more focused ablation with smaller probes. Cryotherapy and APC can also be used for ablation, but photodynamic therapy is now used much less often. \nComplications of \ndiagnostic and therapeutic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy \nDiagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a safe proce-\ndure with minimal morbidity as long as appropriate patient Figure 9.9 A self-expanding metal stent may alle-\nviate symptoms relating to malignant oesophageal strictures.

Particular caution should be exer -\ncised in patients with recent unstable cardiac ischaemia and respiratory compromise. Perforation can occur at any point in the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the oropharynx. It is rare during diagnostic procedures and is usually associated \nwith inexperience. Perforation is more common in therapeutic endoscopy, particularly oesophageal dilatation and EMR/ESD for early malignancy. Early diagnosis signifcantly improves outcome and can potentially be managed endoscopically with clips or endoscopic suturing. \nPrompt management includes radiological assessment \nusing CT/water-soluble contrast studies, strict nil by mouth, intravenous fuids and antibiotics and early review by an expe-rienced upper gastrointestinal surgeon. \nSummary box 9.5 \nSymptoms of endoscopic oesophageal perforation \n\u25cf Neck/chest pain \n\u25cf Increasing tachycardia \n\u25cf Dysphagia/drooling saliva \n\u25cf Hypotension \n\u25cf Abdominal pain \n\u25cf Surgical emphysema \nENDOSCOPIC ASSESSMENT OF THE \nSMALL BOWEL \nIntroduction and indications \nThe requirement to visualise, biopsy and treat the small bowel \nis far less than in the stomach, biliary tree or colon, resulting in a time lag in technological advances.

Other indications \ninclude the investigation of  malabsorption; the exclusion of cryptic small bowel infammation such as Crohn\u2019s disease in patients with diarrhoea/abdominal pain and evidence of  an infammatory response; targeting lesions seen on radiological investigations; and surveillance for neoplasia in patients with inherited polyposis syndromes. \nA standard enteroscope is able to reach and biopsy lesions \ndetected in the proximal small bowel; however, even in the most \nexperienced hands this is limited to approximately 100\u00a0cm dis-tal to the pylorus, although the use of  a stifening overtube may increase this somewhat. The procedure takes approximately 45\u00a0minutes and may be uncomfortable, requiring high doses of sedation with the attendant incr eased risk of  perforation and \nsedation-related morbidity. \nTherefore, until recently, barium follow-through or entero-\nclysis were the most efective imaging modalities to visualise the distal duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Obviously, these techniques do not give true mucosal views, and outside spe-cialist centres their decreasing use has led to diminished expertise and a reduced diagnostic yield. There have been rapid advances in axial radiological techniques such as MRI \nand CT enterography, which demonstrate excellent diagnos-\ntic accuracy in this area (see Chapter 8). However, although these techniques may yield information about vascularity and bowel wall thickening, they do not allow direct mucosal views, have no biopsy capability and have limited scope in ter ms of \ntherapeutics. Historically, if  an area of  interest was outside the reach of  a standard enteroscope, direct access via enterotomy under either laparoscopic or open surgery was required. Two major clinical advances have revolutionised small bowel diag-nosis and therapeutics. First, the development of  the capsule endoscope allows diagnostic mucosal views of  the entire small bowel to be obtained with minimal discomfort in unsedated patients. Second, the novel technique of  single-/doub le-\nballoon enteroscopy allows endoscopic access to the entire small bowel for biopsy and therapeutics (Table 9.4). \nCapsule endoscopy \nThe prototype capsule endoscope was developed at the Royal London Hospital in the UK by Professor Paul Swain. Several companies have developed diferent systems for routine clinical use, but the basic principles remain identical. The  technique requires three main components: an ingestible capsule, a portable data recorder and a workstation equipped with image-processing software. The capsule consists of an optical dome and lens, two light-emitting diodes, a processor, a battery, a transmitter, and an antenna encased in a resistant coat the size of a large vitamin pill (Figure 9.11). It acquires video \nimages during natural propulsion through the digestive system that it transmits via a digital radiofrequency communication channel to the recorder unit worn outside the body; this also \ncontains sensors that allow basic localisation of  the site of image capture within the abdomen.

It compares favourably with other techniques for localisation of  occult gastrointestinal bleeding and the diagnosis of  small bowel Crohn\u2019s disease. Use of  the capsule endoscope is contra-\nindicated in patients with known small bowel strictures in which it may impact, resulting in acute obstruction and requiring retrieval at laparotomy or via laparoscopy. Se vere gastroparesis \nand pseudo-obstruction are also relative contraindications to its use. Some units advocate a barium follow-through or small bowel MRI to exclude stricturing disease in all patients before capsule endoscopy. However, there are well-reported episodes of  capsule impaction in a stricture that was not visualised on prior imaging. Therefore, a \u2018dummy\u2019 patency capsule that can be tracked via a handheld device or conventional radiology as it passes through the intestine should be used in all patients in whom there is a possibility of  stricturing disease.

The \nprocedure is usually carried out under general anaesthesia but may be undertaken with the use of  conscious sedation. The enteroscope and overtube are inserted through either the mouth or anus and steered to the proximal duodenum/ terminal ileum in the conventional manner. Following this the endoscope is advanced a small distance in front of  the overtube and the balloon at the end is infated. Using the assistance of  friction at the interface between the enteroscope and intestinal wall, the small bowel is accordioned back to the overtube. The overtube balloon is then deployed and the enteroscope balloon is defated. \nThe process is then continued until the entire small bowel is \nvisualised (Figure 9.12). In single-balloon enteroscopy, devel-oped more recently, an enteroscope and overtube are used, but only the overtube has a balloon attached. A full range of therapeutics including diagnostic biopsy, polypectomy, APC and stent insertion are a vailable for balloon enteroscopy. \nSome experts advocate routine capsule endoscopy before balloon enteroscopy in an attempt to localise any lesions and plan whether oral or rectal access is more appropriate.

This is then cannulated, either directly with a catheter or with the help of  a guidewire (Figure 9.13). Occasionally a small precut is required to gain access. By altering the angle of  approach \none can selectively cannulate the pancreatic duct or biliary tree, which is then visualised under fuoroscopy after contrast injection. The signifcant range of complica tions associated \nwith this procedure and improvements in radiological imaging using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) have rendered much diagnostic ERCP obsolete, and thus most procedures are currently performed for therapeutic purposes.

It is traditional to insert a tempo-rary plastic stent to maintain drainage as several attempts at dilatation may be required. Self-expanding metal stents are most commonly used for the palliation of  malignant biliary obstruction and are also normally inserted after a modest sphincterotomy. Corr ect stent placement can normally be con-\nfrmed by a fow of  bile after release and by the presence of  air in the biliary tree on follow-up plain abdominal radiographs. Stent malfunction, associated with recurrent or persistent bio-chemical cholestasis, may be due to poor initial stent position, stent migra tion, blockage with blood clot or debris or tumour \ningrowth. A repeat procedure is required to assess the cause, which can usually be r emedied by the insertion of  a second \nstent through the original one. \nIn addition to the standard techniques discussed above, \nERCP is also used for pancreatic disease and the assessment \nof  biliary dysmotility (sphincter of  Oddi dysfunction) using manometr y in specialist centres. Indications include pancre-\natic stone extraction, the dilatation of  pancreatic duct stric-tures and the transgastric drainage of  pancreatic pseudocysts. To minimise the risks of  subsequent pancreatitis, pancreatic \nsphincterotomy is most safely performed after the placement \nof  a temporary pancreatic stent to prev ent stasis within the \npancreatic duct. \nVisualisation and sampling of  biliary lesions is becom-\ning easier and more efective with the development of  newer through-the-duodenoscope cholangioscopes that allow direct \nvisualisation and instrumentation of the biliary and pancrea tic \nducts. \nComplications associated \nwith endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography \nThe same risks associated with other endoscopic procedures \nalso apply to patients undergoing ERCP , but risks may be increased because of  the increased patient frailty and high sedation levels required. Complications specifc to ERCP include duodenal perforation (1.3%), haemorrhage (1.4%) after sphincterotomy, pancreatitis (4.3%) and sepsis (3\u201330%); the mortality rate approaches 1%. It is important to remember that postsphincterotomy complications may be retroperitoneal and CT scanning should be performed in patients with pain, tachycardia or hypotension post procedure. \nAlthough normally mild, post-ERCP pancreatitis can be \nsevere with extensive pancreatic necrosis and is associated with a signifcant mortality rate (Table 9.5). Where there is no contraindication, patients under going ERCP should receive \nper-rectal indometacin or diclofenac immediately before or after the procedure to reduce the risk of  post-ERCP pancre-atitis.

Advances in bowel preparation have enhanced mucosal visualisation. Understanding two key technical aspects of  colonoscopy allows a greater caecal intubation rate and ileal intubation with minimal discomfort using light sedation. The frst is that continued inward pressure of  the endoscope results in loop formation within the mobile sigmoid and transverse colon, which in turn leads to paradoxical movement and loss of  fne tip control. The second is that pulling back the scope regularly with appropriate torque to ensure a straight passage through the sigmoid colon and around the splenic fexure greatly aids the completion of  right-sided examination. \nEndoscopic navigation systems such as Scope Guide \n(Olympus) and Scope Pilot (Pentax) can help to characterise the nature of  the loop, allowing for more accurate loop reso-lution techniques. Increasing the stifness of  the colonoscope, targeted abdominal pressure and regular patient position \nchange are also important aids to successfully reaching the caecum. It is expected that the caecum should be r eached in \nat least 90% of  colonoscopies and is confrmed by the presence of  the appendiceal orifce, the triradiate fold, the ileocaecal valve and preferably terminal ileal intubation (Figure 9.14).

Accordingly, colonoscopy remains the cornerstone of  most colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programmes globally, whether it is used as the initial screen-ing modality or following a faecal immunochemical test (FIT). The goal is to increase the number of  early-stage CRCs detected and hence decrease mortality, as well as to identify and remove adenomatous polyps prior to the development of  overt cancer. Higher adenoma detection rates (ADRs) are associated with lo wer rates of  interval cancers and, as such, \nthe ADR is an important indicator of  colonoscopy quality. ADRs can be improved with measures such as a longer time taken on withdrawal from the caecum, optimal bowel prepa-ration, patient position changes and a \u2018second look\u2019 of  the right colon by changing patient position or by retrofexing the colonoscope.

Lesions >20\u00a0mm can be removed with piecemeal EMR (pEMR); on completion, thermal ablation (with either APC or coagulation) is applied to the edge of  the resection site to prevent adenoma recurrence. An alternative to pEMR is ESD , which is typically performed \nwith a knife rather than a snare. This technique involves the injection of  a submucosal solution, followed by a circumfer -\nential incision and submucosal dissection, with coagulation of \nFigure 9.18 A large angioectasia of the colon.

Delayed haemorrhage may occur 1\u201314 days post \npolypectomy and can normally be managed by conservative observation. Transfusion may occasionally be required, and a repeat colonoscopy may be necessary. If  recognised at the time of  polypectomy, small perforations should be closed using endoclips and the patient may need a period of  observation. Symptoms of  abdominal pain and cardiovascular compromise after a polypectomy raise the possibility of  a delayed perforation and faecal contamination. Patients should be kept nil by mouth and receive intravenous resuscitation and antibiotics. Prompt assessment with a CT scan will often distinguish between a frank perforation and a transmural burn with associated local-ised peritonitis (the postpolypectomy syndrome). Assessment by an experienced colorectal surgeon is essential, as surgery is often the most appropriate course of  action. ENDOSCOPIC UL TRASOUND \nOne disadvantage of conventional endoscopy is that exam-ination is limited to the mucosal surface, and it is not possible to diagnose submucosal or extraintestinal pathology. These limitations can be overcome using EUS, which combines the traditional mucosal image with a separate ultrasound view that clear ly depicts the intestinal layers and proximate \nextraintestinal structures. Its use has revolutionised the staging and management of  upper gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary malignancy. \nThere are two main types of  echoendoscope: the radial \nechoendoscope has a radially arranged ultrasound probe and a forward-viewing lens. This is used for diagnostic work such as local tumour staging in the oesophagus and stomach. The linear echoendoscope is a side-viewing scope with a working channel \nmuch like an ERCP scope, and a linearly arranged ultra-sound probe. This conformation allows ultrasound assessment and ultrasound-guided sampling of  tissues to be performed (Figures 9.20 and 9.21). Sampling of  paraoesophageal and coeliac lymph nodes and pancreatic, biliary and other solid abdominal lesions as well as drainage of  peripancreatic abscess or pseudocysts can be performed. Using TTS Cystotomes\n\u2122 it \nis possible to perform EUS cystgastrostomy and stent place-ment, and increasingly biliary interventional procedures are being performed with EUS assistance. \nEUS requires dedicated training, in both scope manipu-\nlation and radiographic inter pretation. Owing to the width \nand lack of  fexibility of  the endo-ultrasound scope as well as the duration of  complex therapeutic procedures, sedation \nis normally required, and some units perform tests using \npropofol-based anaesthesia. The main indications for EUS are listed in Table 9.6\n. All patients undergoing therapeutic EUS \nrequire a normal coagulation screen. Complications include oversedation and oesophageal perforation during diagnostic procedures and haemorrhage/perforation during therapeutic procedures. \n\u2018Ragged\u2019 edge suggesting invasion of adventitia \nMuscularis propria Tumour \nFigure 9.20 Endoscopic ultrasound image of an oesophageal tumour \ninvading into the wall. \nFigure 9.21  Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fne-needle aspira-\ntion of a pancreatic head mass.

Whereas advances in radiology and capsule studies may obviate the need for some diagnostic procedures, the ability to take mucosal biopsies will ensure that it retains a vital role. Ongoing developments in technology such as magnifying endoscopy and chromoendoscopy give near-histological qual-ity defnition and there is considerable interest in the role of artifcial intelligence to augment near-patient diagnosis. There have also been major advances in the range of  conditions that are amenable to endoscopic therapy; such therapy may have substantially lo wer associated morbidity rates than traditional \nsurgical approaches. However, as the scope of  procedures widens and the age range/comorbidities of  the patients increases, it is beholden on the endoscopist to ensure that he or she adheres to appropriate governance/consent and sedation practice to minimise complications.

This type of  surgery has reduced wound access trauma and is less disfguring than conventional techniques. It can ofer cost-efectiveness to both health services and employ ers by \nshortening operating times, shortening hospital stays, improv-ing operative precision compared with open surgery in some (but not all) cases and allowing faster recuperation. \nHistory of minimal access surgery \nThe frst experimental laparoscopic procedure was performed by Kelling in 1901. Jacobaeus performed the frst thoracoscopy in 1910, again using a cystoscope; however, it took another 70 years before Steptoe in the UK developed laparoscopy for treatment of  infertility and Mouret performed the frst video-laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987. Since laparo-scopic techniques became widely adopted in the mid-1990s, minimal access surgery has developed into a multidisciplinary \napproach that crosses all traditional specialty boundaries and serves the patient as a w hole and not specifc organ systems. \nMINIMAL ACCESS APPROACHES \nLaparoscopy \nA rigid endoscope is introduced through a port into the perito-neal cavity. Full details of  laparoscopy including the principles of  pneumoperitoneum can be found in Chapter 7. \u2022 The perioperative assessment of patients undergoing \nminimal access surgery \n\u2022 Novel advances in minimal access surgery and its adjuncts \n\u2022 The application of artifcial intelligence to minimal access surgery \nThoracoscopy \nA rigid endoscope is introduced through an incision placed \nbetween the ribs to gain access to the thorax. In the majority of  cases, specialist anaesthetic support is required to ensure isolation of  the lung on the side of  surgery, enabling the patient to be ventilated only on the non-operative side. This is achieved through the use of right- or left-sided double lumen endotracheal tubes that comprise both a bronchial and a tracheal lumen. Usually there is no requirement for gas insufation as the operating space is held open by the rigidity of  the thoracic cavity. In specifc cases, such as mediastinal tumour resection and diaphragmatic surgery, gas insufation at low pressure (5\u20138\u00a0mmHg) may be applied. Further infor -\nmation on the general principles of  thoracoscopy are found in Chapter 60. \nSingle-incision minimal access surgery \nSingle-incision minimal access surgery has varied in popularity with both strong advocates and others who are sceptical of any advantages. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) involves insertion of  all instrumentation through a multiple channel port via a single incision at the umbilicus. The benefts are that the incision, through a natural scar (the umbilicus), is virtually \u2018scarless\u2019 and that fewer port sites potentially reduces pain and lessens the risks of  port site bleeding and the potential for port site hernia. \nSILS requires specially manufactured multichannel ports \nand often roticulating instruments. It has most commonly been adopted in gallbladder and hernia surgery, although more \nGeorg Kelling, 1866\u20131945, surgeon, Dresden, Germany, performed the frst \u2018celioscopy\u2019 on a dog in 1901 using air insufation and a Nitze-cystoscope. \nHans Christian Jacobaeus, 1879\u20131937, physician, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden.

There \nremains debate as to whether the increased procedural dif-culty, steep learning curve and increased direct costs in terms of  devices, instruments and operating time can be ofset by signifcant clinical beneft. \nUniportal thoracic surgery requires less specialist equip-\nment; many minor thoracic procedures are commonly per -\nformed using this technique. More complex resectional \nprocedures are less commonly performed, largely because of technical complexity when compared with multiport tech-\nniques, which are on the whole very well tolerated. \nEndoluminal endoscopy and natural \norifce surgery \nFlexible or rigid endoscopes are introduced into hollow \norgans or systems, such as the urinary tract, upper or lower gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory and vascular systems. Advances in endoluminal technology now enable more complex procedures to be completed endoscopically where previous transabdominal or transthoracic surgical resection would have been advocated. Examples include endoscopic submucosal resection of  complex colonic polyps, transanal endoscopic microsurgery and endobronchial laser resection of tracheal pathology. \nNatural orifce translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) \nofers the opportunity for \u2018scar-free\u2019 surgery by performing entire procedures via natural body orifces. While these tech -\nniques have been applied in the pelvis, abdomen and thorax, technical limitations and safety concerns have limited adop-tion. Concern over closure of  the visceral puncture site is the principal issue that has prevented widespr ead uptake, as trans-\ngastric and transcolonic closure of  peritoneal entry sites in a safe manner remains problematic. In addition, there ar e sig-\nnifcant cost and training implications that have limited more widespread adoption. \nPerivisceral endoscopy \nBody planes can be accessed even in the absence of  a natural cavity. Examples are mediastinoscopy, retroperitoneoscopy and retroperitoneal approaches to the kidney, aorta and lumbar sympathetic chain. Some of  these approaches have been in place for many years (cervical mediastinoscopy was frst performed in 1959); however, the availability of  novel videoscopes has enhanced visualisation, thus improving the safety and accuracy of  dissection. \nExtraperitoneal approaches to the retroperitoneal organs, \nas well as hernia repair, are now commonplace, further decreasing morbidity associated with manipulation of  the visceral peritoneum. Other examples include subfascial \nendoscopic perforator surgery for ligation of  incompetent perforating veins in varicose vein surgery and endoscopic harvesting of  the saphenous vein for use in coronary artery bypass grafting. Arthroscopy and intra-articular joint \nsurgery \nArthroscopy was one of  the earliest applications of  endoscopic \ntechniques, frst being applied in the knee as early as the 1930s. In the 1950s Watanabe developed arthroscopic techniques that have evolved such that shoulder, wrist, elbow and hip arthros-copy is now commonplace.

In this way, the surgeon\u2019s hand can be used as in an open procedure. It can be used to palpate organs or tumours, refect organs atraumatically, retract structures, identify vessels, dissect bluntly along a tissue plane and provide fnger pressure to bleeding points, while proximal control is achieved. This approach has been suggested to ofer technical and economic efciency when compared with a totally laparoscopic approach, in some instances reducing both the number of  laparoscopic ports and the number of  instru-ments required. Indeed, some advocates argue that if  such an incision is necessary for extraction of  the fnal specimen then HALS does not signifcantly increase surgical trauma over totally laparoscopic approaches. Furthermore, for those \ntrained in open surgery it may be easier to learn and perform than totally laparoscopic approaches, subsequently improving patient safety. With the new generation of  surgeons training in totally laparoscopic surgery it is likely that use of  HALS will diminish, although it should remain part of  the minimally invasive surgeon\u2019s armamentarium. \nSURGICAL TRAUMA IN OPEN, \nMINIMALL Y INVASIVE AND ROBOTIC SURGERY \nMost of the trauma of an open procedure is inficted because \nthe surgeon must have a wound that is large enough to give adequate exposure for safe dissection at a target site. The wound is often the cause of  morbidity, including infection, dehiscence, bleeding, herniation and nerve entrapment. Wound pain prolongs recovery time and, by reducing mobility, contributes to an increased incidence of  pulmonary atelectasis, chest infection, paralytic ileus and deep venous thrombosis. \nMechanical and human retractors cause additional trauma. \nBody wall retractors can infict localised damage that may be as painful as the wound itself. In contrast, during laparoscopy, the retraction is provided by the low-pressur e pneumoperitoneum, \ngiving a difuse force applied gently and evenly over the whole body wall, causing minimal trauma. \nExposure of  any body cavity to the atmosphere also causes \nmorbidity through cooling and fuid loss by evaporation. The incidence of  postsurgical adhesions is reduced by use of mini-\nmally invasive approaches because there is less damage to del-icate serosal coverings. In the manual handling of  intestinal loops, the surgeon and assistant disturb the peristaltic activity of  the gut and provoke adynamic ileus. \nWhile minimal access methods were initially established in \nelective surgery, the advantages have led to increased uptake for a number of  emergency surgical procedures, including perforated viscus repair, such as omental patch repair of  a \npeptic ulcer perforation, lavage of  localised perforation of diverticular disease, intrathoracic debridement of  empyema and pneumothorax and haemothorax surgery. More recently, some experienced surgeons have chosen to employ minimal access approaches to trauma situations for initial assessment and treatment in stable patients.

On occasion, a minimally invasive operation is so technically demanding that both patient and surgeon would be better served by conversion to an open procedure. Prolonged anaesthetic and operative times may negate a number of the benefcial efects of  minimal access surgery and increase the risk of  respiratory and wound complications as well as compression neuropathy and venous thromboembolism. It is vital for surgeons and patients to appreciate that the decision to convert to an open operation is not a complication but, instead, usually implies sound surgical judgement in favour of  patient safety. \nControl of bleeding and haemostasis \nHaemostasis may be difcult to achieve endoscopically because blood may obscure the feld of  vision with reduced image quality owing to light absorption. Experienced surgeons may be able to manage a degree of  bleeding via an endoscopic approach; however, this requires a signifcant degree of  experience and skill to be achieved safely. Such scenarios are also reliant on an experienced assistant able to reduce visual loss through optimal camera positioning. It should be remembered that a situation of  controlled conversion can easily become uncontrolled, negating any beneft a minimally access approach would have achieved. \nAdvanced electrosurgery/diathermy and laser technology \nhave improved dissection precision and haemostatic efcacy in endoscopic surgery. Ultrasonic dissection and tissue fusion \ndevices continue to evolve with incremental technical improve-ments and surgeons are increasingly familiar with their use. Some devices now combine the functions of three or four sep -\narate instruments, reducing the need for instrument exchanges \nduring a procedure. This fexibility, combined with the abil-\nity to provide a clean, smoke-free feld, facilitates dissection, \nimproves haemostasis and reduces operating times . \nLoss of tactile feedback \nMinimal access surgery is associated with some loss of tactile feedback, although this is less with straight stick endoscopy than with robotic procedures. This is an area of  ongoing research in haptics and biofeedback systems. Early work suggested that laparoscopic ultrasonography might be a substitute for the need to \u2018feel\u2019 in intraoperative decision-making. Rather than producing tactile feedback, endoscopic ultrasound provides a visual representation of  structures that in open surgery would rely on palpation for accurate localisation and appraisal. Widely used examples include appraisal of  nodal disease in cancer surgery and biliary tract exploration. \nTissue extraction \nLarge pieces of  tissue, such as the lung or colon, may have to be extracted from the body cavity following resection. In some circumstances this signifcantly increases the surgical trauma of  the procedure that could otherwise be carried out via two or three small port incisions. Although tissue \u2018morcellators, mincers and liquidisers\u2019 can be used in some circumstances, they have the disadvantage of  disrupting gross specimen morphology and cannot be used in surgery for malignancy. Typically, extraction is performed by enlarging one incision so as to facilitate remov al without disruption to the specimen. \nStrategies to reduce surgical trauma have been considered. These include removal of lung via a subxiphoid approach so as to reduce intercostal neuropraxia or natural orifce extraction of abdominal resection specimens. However, such approaches are themselves associated with diferent complications such as herniation and injury to structures outside the direct operative feld. \nWhile tumour implantation and localisation at port sites \ninitially raised important questions about the future of  the laparoscopic treatment of malignancy, large-scale trials have shown concer ns to be minimised by appropriate tissue han-\ndling, separating any tumours by bagging, irrigation and pro-tecting the extraction site. \nCost \nInitially high consumable costs and factors such as surgical learning curve and high conversion rates led to increased costs of  minimal access approaches compared with their open equivalents. This is now largely no longer the case for straight stick endoscopic surgery such as laparoscopy and thoracoscopy. Indeed, despite higher direct consumable costs, improvements in outcomes, hospital stay and general upscaling of  the proce-dural volume have resulted in improved cost-efectiveness for many minimal access procedures.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4757, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afe7f93a-91ff-48db-af77-afe2f86c6bee": {"__data__": {"id_": "afe7f93a-91ff-48db-af77-afe2f86c6bee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a1dd1392-df3f-4f75-8b89-db32f9f077ef", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07"}, "hash": "437446d9f60e5eb0e71f50b4605905fd58ae4c76c4da062329d586aa336a1bd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8127b2e3-3302-41f5-a963-16873892ef1d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07"}, "hash": "23499be7429d288032f1d1da3d189557af1ac1b2b9a748a9354172e9b28a7491", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This is now largely no longer the case for straight stick endoscopic surgery such as laparoscopy and thoracoscopy.

Reduced degrees of  freedom of movement and difcult ergonomic positioning for the surgeon can limit the application of  straight stick endoscopy to a number of  special-ties owing to a loss in surgical precision. This has driven the uptake of  robotic surgical systems, currently existing as two main categories: \n\u25cf Teleoperated (master\u2013slave) systems: a surgeon \nperforms an operation via a robot and its robotic instru-ments through a televisual computerised platform (where the surgeon is the master, i.e. the operator, and the robot is the slave). This may be via onsite connections or remotely \nthrough the internet or other digital channels \u2013 hence the publicity of  \u2018operating on a patient from another country\u2019 (such \u2018remote\u2019 operations are currently rarely performed but their existence is established). \n\u25cf Active or semiactive systems: these are typically image-guided or pre-programmed. \nIn active sys-\ntems, a surgical robot completes a pre-programmed surgical task. This is guided by preoperative imaging and real-time anatomical constraints and cues through the application of in-built navigation systems. In semiactive systems, the \nrobotic device may be in part pre-programmed and in part surgeon driven. \nHistory of robotic surgery \nThe frst documented clinical robotic procedure was a computed tomography (CT)-guided brain biopsy performed in 1985 utilising the PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly) 560 system. This was followed by the ROBODOC, a pre-programmed active robot that enabled precise preparation of  the femoral implant cavity during hip replacement. The beneft of such a device was the ability to perform tasks to a high degree of  accuracy, thus minimising error and variation. While this and other active surgical robots demonstrated a number of  advantages, they were largely superseded by the advent of wider laparoscopy and thoracos-copy, which became increasingly commonplace across during the 1990s and 2000s. \nIn 1992, Computer Motion developed the AESOP (Auto-\nmated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning) system, which mounted the endoscopic camera on a single robotic arm, allowing the surgeon to control it r emotely via voice com-\nmand. The system was widely used in cholecystectomy and hernia surgery and for harvesting the mammary conduit in \ncoronary artery bypass. This was followed by the de velopment \nof  the ZEUS robot in 1996, a master\u2013slave teleoperated system that provided three robotic arms, one for the voice-controlled endoscope and two further instrument arms. The surgeon was positioned at a remote console and the device was capable of motion scaling and tremor correction, facilitating its use for microsurgical procedures. ZEUS was used for the frst fully endoscopic robotic surgical procedure, the reanastomosis of a Fallopian tube in 1998. The frst remote surgical procedure was performed in 2001, also utilising the ZEUS system. Here a cholecystectomy was performed on a patient in Paris by a surgeon in New York, demonstrating the feasibility of  remote operating. ZEUS was discontinued in 2003 after the merger of Computer Motion with Intuitive Surgical. \nThe current era of  surgical robots is dominated by the da \nVinci\n\u00ae surgical system, which was frst approved for clinical use \nin 2000. The system ofers a number of  advantages, including 3D surgical vision, EndoWrist\n\u00ae precision instruments, tremor \nreduction, motion scaling and improved ergonomics. The ini-tial system was released in 1999 and provided three robotic arms, one of  which held the endoscope. This was upgraded to the da Vinci S (2006), the da Vinci Si (2009) and subsequently the da Vinci Xi in 2014 (Figure 10.2).

Just as laparoscopic surgery benefted from advances in light technology allowing the targeted transmission of  light down tubing, robotic surgery benefts from computer integration of  mechanical (surgical) arms that have paved the way for computer-integrated surgery. \nVision \nModern robotic camera systems ofer 3D high-defnition imag-ing, providing stereoscopic vision with true depth perception that enhances the visualisation of  tissue planes and key struc-tures. Multiport systems typically employ a rigid endoscope with or without angulation. As with conventional endoscopes, angulation to 30\u00b0 allows for a wider range of  vision thr ough \nmanipulation of  the camera position, which, in the case of robotic surgery , can be controlled by the surgeon at the console \nor, if  required, by the assistant at the bedside. A reference horizon is commonly provided to the surgeon at the console system so as to maintain orientation throughout the procedure. More recently, modern single-port systems such as the da Vinci SP employ a wristed camera system that, in combination with fully wristed instruments, may allow for operative triangulation while at the same time maintaining a small, single skin incision. \nManoeuvrability, motion scaling and tremor \nsuppression \nImproved manoeuvring as a result of the \u2018robotic wrist\u2019 \nin some systems allows for up to seven degrees of  freedom, thus improving dexterity for the surgeon. This has particular benefts in felds with signifcant space restraints such as transoral surgery, where conventional laparoscopy has limited applicability. Furthermore, the increased dexterity of  surgical robots may facilitate a minimal access approach to more complex procedures where the technical difculty of  applying conventional laparoscopy may be prohibitive. As the motion of  the surgeon\u2019s hand is translated to the \u2018slave\u2019 motion of  the robotic arm, modern surgical robots are able to scale down large external movements of  the surgical hands to limited internal movements. At the same time, the computer may flter out tremor in the surgeon\u2019s hands, thus ensuring stability of  the instrument tips and enhancing surgical precision. \nErgonomics \nAlthough the advent of straight stick laparoscopic surgery had many advantages for the patient, for the surgeon there was a trade-of in terms of operative ergonomics. Increased operative time in addition to unergonomic positioning can result in signifcant physical discomfort for the surgeon. This is particularly true in specialties such as bariatric surgery, where the patient\u2019s body habitus and the use of  long, fulcrumed instruments puts further strain on the surgeon\u2019s back, neck and upper arms. The advent of  robotic surgery vastly improves upon the ergonomic environment for the surgeon; in the case of  many of  the current master\u2013slave systems, allowing for the surgeon to be seated at a console remote from the operating table (Figure 10.3). The console positioning can be optimised to ft the individual profle of  the operator, thus reducing phys-ical stress and fatigue. The enclosed console system of  many robotic systems also provides the advantage of  surgical isolation from external distractions that may impact on the operator\u2019s concentration. The disadv antage is reduced awareness of \nnon-verbal communication, thus highlighting the importance of  team training and regular verbal cues. \nMotion compensation \nAlthough not commonplace in current clinical practice, robotic surgical systems may in future provide motion compensation to facilitate surgery on a moving target. Examples where this may be benefcial are in beating heart cardiac surgery, such as coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve repair. In this setting, the increased dexterity of robotic surgery combined with removing the need for cardioplegia and cross-clamping may be particularly benefcial in terms of  reducing the post-operative infammatory response and improving its associated morbidity. \nDisadvantages of robotic surgery \nCost \nRobotic surgery remains more costly than minimally invasive alternatives.

Specialties that use microsurgical techniques also beneft from this technology. Current robotic systems were designed to ofer multifunctionality, including multianatomy and specialty capability in both operating theatre and remote environments. Currently, despite a small \nnumber of  reports of  remote surgical procedures, robotic surgery remains focused on in-house operating. \nNew entrants \nIn 2017, Intuitive Surgical released the da Vinci X, a low-cost entry point in its robotic surgical portfolio that includes features of  the Xi while sacrifcing some fexibility in terms of  multi-quadrant surgery. In the same year, Korean company Meere gained a licence for the use of  its surgical robot, the REVO-I, by the local Ministry for Food and Drug Safety. Similar to the da Vinci, this four-arm robot is mounted on a single cart. The surgeon is seated at an open vision cart and, by use of  3D glasses, can achieve three-dimensional high-defnition (3D-HD) vision. In March 2019, CMR Surgical received a European CE mark for its novel modular robot, the Versius (Figure 10.4). This system incorporates individual cart-mounted modular robotic arms that can be confgured to ft the procedure and the operating room environment. The design difers from other robotic arms in that it aims to more closely mimic a human arm, improving freedom of  port placement. Its vision cart \nsimilarly allows for ergonomic operating with 3D-HD vision, through the use of  3D glasses. \nBridging the gap between laparoscopic and robotic surgery \nthe Senhance\n\u00ae robotic system received its CE mark in 2016. \nIn order to reduce cost and sustain familiarity with conven-tional laparoscopy, the system uses independent robotic arms mounted on separate carts that can be placed in accordance with the procedure required. T he system utilises reusable non-\nwristed instruments that can be inserted through standard \nFigure 10.4  The Versius robotic system (courtesy of CMR Surgical). laparoscopic trocars so as to reduce consumable cost. This system also creates familiarity with conventional laparoscopy and facilitates hybrid techniques where this may be benefcial. Surgery is enhanced though a 3D-HD system with the use of 3D glasses and eye-tracking camera control. \nAs the feld of  robotic surgery continues to expand and \ninnovate, there also remain a number of  systems in devel-opment that are not yet approv ed for clinical use. Examples \nsimilar to existing technologies include the Medtronic Hugo Robotic-Assisted Surgery (RAS) system, which was launched \nin late 2019. This modular system aims to provide a low er cost \nalternative by means of  a more readily upgradeable model that may be used fexibly across surgical specialties and procedures. Moving forward, companies such as Verb Surgical strive to build on the currently dominant master\u2013slave model, incorpo-rating robotic autonomy and machine learning.

A prior history of  surgical intervention in the same area is vitally important and should be carefully documented, so as to best predict factors such as adhesions that may preclude a minimal access approach.

Although, in general, minimal access surgery allows quicker recovery, it may involve longer operat-ing times and carbon dioxide insufation in both the chest and abdomen may provoke cardiac arrhythmias. Severe chronic obstructive airways disease and ischaemic heart disease may be contraindica tions to a minimal access approach. Moderate \nobesity does not increase operative difculty signifcantly, but morbid obesity may require specialist instrumentation and trocars. Patients with a particularly low body mass index and small body habitus may present separate challenges in terms of  port placement, particularly when adopting a robotic approach. Severe spinal deformity including kyphosis and scoliosis may present problems in terms of  positioning as well as impact on overall recovery if there are associated problems with sputum clearance and mobility. \nProphylaxis against thromboembolism \nVenous stasis induced by the reverse Trendelenburg position during laparoscopic surgery coupled with prolonged duration of  operation are risk factors for deep vein thrombosis. Subcuta-neous low-molecular-weight heparin and antithromboembolic stockings should be used routinely in addition to pneumatic calf compression during the operation. Patients already taking anticoagulation should have this stopped temporarily or , where \nappropriate, be converted to intravenous or subcutaneous heparin, depending on the underlying condition and local thromboprophylaxis protocols. In most cases patients can continue on aspirin when the benefts outweigh the slight increase in bleeding potential. \nUrinary catheters and nasogastric tubes \nIn the early days of  minimal access surgery, routine bladder catheterisation and nasogastric intubation were advised. Most surgeons now omit these in favour of  enhanced recovery, which has demonstrated benefts in terms of  both length of stay and morbidity outcomes. It remains essential to check that the patient has fasted and has recently emptied their bladder, particularly before creating pneumoperitoneum for minimal access surgery approaches to the abdomen. \nInformed consent \nIt is essential that the patient understands the nature of  the procedure, the risks involved and, when appropriate, the alternatives that are available. A locally prepared explanatory booklet concerning the minimal access procedure to be under -\ntaken is extremely useful (Chapter 14). The patient should understand that the procedure may be converted to an open operation. Common complications should be mentioned, such as shoulder tip pain and minor surgical emphysema, as well as rare but serious complications, suc h as inadvertent visceral \ninjury from trocar insertion or diathermy. Patients may also have specifc questions or requests in terms of  the application of  minimal access surgery. It is important to be considerate and address these. Some patients remain concerned about the application of  technology, particularly robotics, to their care and it is important to ensure they understand and agree with the proposed surgical approach. \nTHEATRE SET-UP AND TOOLS \nOperating theatre design is key to efciency. Modern theatres are designed with moveable booms for video, diathermy and laparoscopic equipment with at least two high-resolution, high-defnition (HD) or ultra-high-defnition (4K) monitors, a carbon dioxide supply and fow monitor and appropriate audiovisual kit (Figure 10.1). \nImage quality is vital to the success of  minimal access \nsurgery.

Before trocar insertion, the introduction of  a fn-\ngertip helps to ascertain penetration into the body cavity and allows adhesions to be gently removed from the entry site. The endoscopic camera may be used as a blunt dissector to tease \nadhesions gently awa y and form a tunnel towards the quad-\nrant where the operation is to take place. With experience, the surgeon learns to diferentiate visually between thick adhesions that should be avoided and thin adhesions that would lead to \na window into a free area. \nIn obese patients the location of  some of  the ports ma y \nneed to be modifed and, in some instances, larger and lon-ger instruments may be necessary. It is important to recognise this preoperatively to ensure that adequate measures are put in place to ensure safe and efcient surger y when the patient \narrives. It is also important to consider the weight and dimen -\nsion restrictions of  the operating table. In some cases, specialist operating tables will be required (Chapter 68). \nOperative problems \nIntraoperative perforation of a viscus or \nvascular injury \nPerforation of  any viscus, such as bowel, is a potential hazard \nthat may occur inadvertently and go unrecognised or be of  a severity that may require emergency conversion. The added time required for this to take place may result in increased blood loss and haemodynamic instability that would not have occurred should the same injury have occurred in an open setting. With surgical experience, education, preparation and patient selection many of  these emergencies and their resultant complications can be avoided. It is vital for the surgical team to both recognise its own limitations and continually refect throughout the procedure on the surgical progress and oper -\native difculty. \nBleeding \nBleeding is the most common cause of  conversion to open surgery. The impact of  light absorption is particularly import-ant in robotic surgery, and regular haemostasis is paramount to facilitate dissection and surgical progress. Risk factors that predispose to increased bleeding include: \n\u25cf liver disease impacting on the production of  vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, e.g. cirrhosis, autoimmune liver disease; \n\u25cf infammatory conditions (acute cholecystitis, diverticulitis); \n\u25cf patients on anticoagulants; \n\u25cf coagulation defects: these may be contraindications to both open and minimal access surgery and require thorough dis-cussion with haematology colleagues to determine, where possible, how to optimise the patient for surgery. \nDamage to a large vessel requires immediate assessment of \nthe magnitude and type of  bleeding. It is paramount that as \nsoon as b leeding is identifed this is communicated clearly to \nall members of  the theatre and anaesthetic team. There should be a relatively lo w threshold for early conversion; however, this \nwill depend on the expertise of  the operating team. It is per -\ntinent to achieve early control by whatever means necessary. When the bleeding vessel can be identifed and grasped, con-trol may be achieved by clipping, stapling or use of  an energy device, depending on vessel size. Occasionally suturing may be possible; however, this may be signifcantly more complex via a minimal access approac h. When the vessel is not identi-\nfed, compression should be applied immediately with a blunt instrument, a cotton swab or with the adjacent organ. Good suction and irrigation are of  utmost importance. Once the area has been cleaned, pressure should be released gradually to identify the site of  bleeding. Insertion of  an e xtra port may \nbe required. There should be no delay in converting to an open procedure when necessary. This is of  particular importance in robotic surgery as some or all of  the robotic arms may need to be urgently undocked to facilitate the surgeon gaining bedside access to the patient. The bedside assistant should be confdent to perform this process. It is sometimes appropriate for a single robotic arm to be left in place to help maintain pressure on the bleeding vessel while direct access is achieved.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4297, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2615f329-7236-42f3-a458-bd883d9df3e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "2615f329-7236-42f3-a458-bd883d9df3e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07", "entities": ["bleeding"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7bd868c9-ffc8-42f3-a023-e1ec1642b38c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07"}, "hash": "db06c3ed2b22aa2bc56eaab6e50c92f2de41385119a82135f1025eaefae2c3ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c62b88a0-5256-4e68-a6a1-35d6dad8d7d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07"}, "hash": "c61b7e2b07377fcfcedb10efa732c2482f0972bcab071c13cdda90b46cd4aee6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "There should be no delay in converting to an open procedure when necessary.

The bedside assistant should be confdent to perform this process. It is sometimes appropriate for a single robotic arm to be left in place to help maintain pressure on the bleeding vessel while direct access is achieved. Alternatively, pressure may be maintained via an assistant port (if  present), allowing the robot to be undocked completely and removed from the surgical feld. \nBleeding from organs encountered during surgery \nExcessive retraction can tear a visceral surface, resulting in bleeding. This is particularly so in robotic surgery, where instrument graspers have a small surface area, increasing the potential for injury to retracted tissue. Here rolled swabs may be inserted into the surgical feld and held within the grasper, producing a larger surface for retraction and reducing tissue injury. Surgicel\n\u00ae (absorbable fbrillar oxidised cellulose \npolymer) or other clot-promoting strips, tissue glues or other haemostatic agents may also be used to aid haemostasis, e.g. from the gallbladder bed during cholecystectomy. \nBleeding from a trocar site \nBleeding from the trocar sites is usually treated by localised diathermy or applying upwards and lateral pressure with the trocar itself. Considerable bleeding may occur if  a vessel such as the inferior epigastric or intercostal artery is injured. Haemostasis can be accomplished either by pressure or by suturing the bleeding site. Devices such as the EndoClose\u2122 may also be used to apply transabdominal sutures under direct laparoscopic view to close port sites that bleed. \nWhen a bleeding vessel cannot be easily identifed, mass \nligation of  the vessel around the port site can be performed. This manoeuvre is accomplished by extending the skin incision by 3\u00a0mm at both ends of  the bleeding trocar site w ound. Two \nfgure-of-eight sutures are placed in the path of  the vessel at both ends of  the wound (Figure 10.5). Alternatively, pressure \ncan be applied using a Foley balloon catheter. The catheter is introduced into the abdominal cavity through the bleeding trocar site wound, the balloon is infated and traction is placed on the catheter, which is bolstered in place to keep it under ten-sion.

The loop is suspended and \ncompression is achieved. Maintaining compression throughout the procedure usually sufces. After the procedure has been completed, the loop is removed under direct laparoscopic visu-alisation to ensure complete haemostasis. \nEvacuation of blood clots \nCareful haemostasis is important as even small, localised pools of  blood or clot absorb light and can signifcantly impair the surgical view. Carefully directed suction is usually sufcient in open cases; however, suction may be problematic in laparo-scopic and robotic procedures that are reliant on carbon diox-ide insufation to maintain the surgical feld. It is important that suction is applied below a fuid level, or, if  used in the operative feld, only in short bursts as required. Should tissue be inadvertently sucked into the end of  the suction device, the tubing can be kinked to allow the tissue to dr op away before \nremoving. Rolled swabs or sponges can be used to remove blood from the surgical feld without need for suction (Figure 10.6). These can also be used for gentle retraction, minimising tissue damage and thus further reducing blood loss. Such swabs may \nbe inserted and removed via a 15-mm assistant port or in some cases a 12-mm robotic trocar with the port cap r emoved. Care \nshould be taken to avoid carbon dioxide loss during extraction. Finally, the surgeon may choose to use a specially designed robotic sucker that integrates with the robotic system. Alterna-tively, non-wristed suction can be provided via an assistant port if  included in the operative set-up. \nPrinciples of electrosurgery during \nlaparoscopic surgery \nInadvertent electrosurgical injuries during minimal access \nsurgery are potentially serious and are often unrecognised at the time. The vast majority occur following the use of  monopolar diathermy. For conventional laparoscopy, the overall incidence is thought to be between one and two cases per 1000 operations. Injuries can occur through inadvertent touching or grasping of  tissue during current application; direct coupling between tissue and a metal instrument that is touching the activated probe; insulation breaks in the laparoscopic or robotic instru-ments; direct sparking from the diathermy probe; or current \nFigure 10.5  Management of bleeding from a surgical trocar site. passage from recently coagulated, electrically isolated tissue. Bipolar diathermy is safer and should be used in preference to monopolar diathermy, especially in anatomically crowded areas. If  monopolar diathermy is to be used, important safety measures include attainment of  a perfect visual image, avoid-ing excessive current application and meticulous attention to insulation. Alternative methods of  performing dissection, such as the use of  ultrasonic devices, may improve safety. \nPOSTOPERATIVE CARE \nThe postoperative care of  patients after minimal access surgery is generally straightforward, with a low incidence of  pain or other problems when compared with their open counterparts. It is a good general rule that if  the patient develops a fever or tachycardia, or complains of  severe pain at the operation site, something is wrong and close observation or intervention is necessary (see also Chapter 24). \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure 10.6 Use of rolled swabs for retraction of the lung during \npulmonary lobectomy (courtesy of Mr Tom Routledge, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3617, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1104616d-a259-4d45-bab4-68506d3e9819": {"__data__": {"id_": "1104616d-a259-4d45-bab4-68506d3e9819", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5858f8ab-8493-4235-a3d5-26f4e5f09aa3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "split_4.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/encyclopedia_1/split_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 29558312, "creation_date": "2024-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-07"}, "hash": "0607fb0326207362c757c378b06b991cc384a9a47525db61a2867f864223d2bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e77b2cad-919f-47bc-9fdb-f4a647af28b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "23068bd2d7fc98707f4ad55f559f36e5eb9a961cd2a74aea028e975b4336880f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "01_10_B&L28_Pt1_Ch10_5th.indd  17201_10_B&L28_Pt1_Ch10_5th.indd  172 31/08/2022  10:3131/08/2022  10:31\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPART 1 | BASIC PRINCIPLES172 CHAPTER 10 Principles of minimal access surgery \nNausea \nAbout half  of  patients experience some degree of  nausea after minimal access surgery. It usually responds to an antiemetic, such as ondansetron, and settles within 12\u201324 hours. It is made worse by opiate analgesics and these should be rationalised or avoided where at all possible. \nShoulder tip pain \nPatients should be warned about this preoperatively and informed that the pain is referred from the diaphragm and that it is not due to a local problem in the shoulders. It can be at its worst 24 hours after the operation. It usually settles within 2\u20133 days and is relieved by simple analgesics, such as paracetamol. \nPort site pain and numbness \nPain in one or other of  the port site wounds is not uncommon and is worse if  there is haematoma formation. It usually settles very rapidly. In the case of  thoracoscopy, intercostal nerve pain may be more common in those with smaller intercostal spaces. Nerve blockade by means of  directed local anaesthesia is efective at reducing pain and the need for opiate medication in the immediate postoperative period. Increasing pain after 2\u20133 days may be a sign of  infection and, with concomitant signs, antibiotic therapy is occasionally required. Occasionally, herniation through a port may account for localised pain and should be considered, particularly if  occurring late with a relevant preceding history (e.g. coughing). Failure of  a patient to follow the expected recovery pathway should prompt senior review with appropriate imaging and relook surgery if  consid-ered necessary. \nAnalgesia \nThe type and extent of  analgesic requirement will depend on both the patient and procedural factors. Prior experience of  opiate analgesia may increase patient tolerance to similar agents, necessitating larger doses. There is also evidence to suggest that those patients struggling with chronic pain preoperatively often present a more complex postoperative analgesic problem. The extent and region of  surgery will also dictate the analgesic regimen. For example, even mini-mal access thoracic surgical procedures commonly require patient-controlled opiate analgesia with or without local nerve blockade (intercostal or paravertebral) in the initial 48 hours after surgery. T his may be avoided for some abdominal surgery \nby careful use of  non-steroidal agents and paracetamol. Opiate analgesics cause nausea, impair gut motility and should be avoided unless the pain is very severe. When pain is dispropor -\ntionate to the presenting problem, suspect a complication (see also Chapter 23). \nOrogastric or nasogastric tube \nAn orogastric or nasogastric tube may be placed for some abdominal surgery if  the stomach is distended and obscuring the view. It is not necessary in all cases and is very rarely used in other minimal access surgery. Where possible, it should be removed as soon as the operation is over and before the patient regains consciousness. This is most commonly used in bariatric and oesophagogastric surgery, where a larger (32F or 34F) tube is used. \nOral fuids \nThere is no signifcant ileus after minimal access surgery, except in abdominal resectional procedures, such as colectomy or small bowel resection. Patients may resume oral fuids as soon as they are conscious; they usually do so 4\u20136 hours after the end of  the operation. \nOral feeding \nProvided that the patient has an appetite, a light meal can be taken 4\u20136 hours after the operation. Some patients remain slightly nauseated at this stage, but almost all eat a normal breakfast on the morning after surgery. Subsequently a balanced diet is recommended in most cases and where specifc procedural recommendations are needed these should be clearly communicated to both the patient and relatives with appropriate dietetic referral made. \nUrinary catheter \nThe requirement for a urinary catheter depends on the opera-tion.

In shorter (<4 hours) minimal access procedures a urinary catheter is not usually required. If  a urinary catheter has been placed in the bladder during an operation with likely short stay, it can be removed before the patient reg ains conscious-\nness if  the procedure has been uneventful. Postoperatively it is important to check that the patient has been able to pass urine and empty their bladder without difculty. When there is \nuncertainty point-of-care bladder scanning can assess residual bladder volume. \nDrains \nThe use of postoperative drains depends on the operation performed. Drain output should initially be documented at least hourly or more regularly in the event of  concern regard-ing high drain output. Given the heterogeneity of drainage systems available it is paramount that nursing staf are familiar with the system used. The exact loca tion and size of  any drains \nshould be clearly documented in the operation notes and the tubing labelled accordingly. This avoids inadvertent removal of the wrong drain or confusion for the ward team. Continued blood loss from a drain is an indication for re-exploration and should be immediately highlighted to the operating surgeon. \nDISCHARGE FROM HOSPITAL \nThe discharge of  patients is based on clinical indicators and the patient\u2019s ftness for recuperating in a non-hospital environ-ment. One of  the core drivers for the application of minimally invasive surgery is an earlier recovery and therefore discharge from hospital.

They should be told that if  they develop worsen-\ning pain or other severe symptoms they should return to the hospital or to their general practitioner. Even for more major cases, some units have demonstrated safe and feasible protocols for a 23-hour stay. \nSkin sutures \nIf  non-absorbable sutures or skin staples have been used, they can be removed from the port sites after 7\u201310 days. \nMobility and convalescence \nPatients can get out of  bed to go to the toilet as soon as they have recovered from the anaesthetic and they should be encouraged to do so. Such movements are remarkably pain free when compared with the mobility achieved after an open operation. Similarly, patients can cough actively and clear bronchial secretions, and this helps to diminish the incidence of  chest infections. \nFURTHER DEVELOPMENTS \nAugmented reality and minimal access \nsurgical adjuncts \nThe future of  minimal access surgery will almost certainly \nfeature more advanced applications of  adjuncts to facilitate anatomical recognition and the localisation of  pathology. These are becoming commonplace in both video-assisted and robotic-assisted procedures. \nAugmented reality \nAugmented reality by defnition comprises the fusion of projected computerised images with a real environment. In surgery, this involves the application of  real-time imaging or other data overlaid via computer processing software onto the surgical feld. Such technology may be particularly benefcial in minimal access surgery where the localisation of  pathology and identifcation of  anatomy may be more difcult than in open surgery because of  the lack of  digital palpation of  the relevant structures. At an elementary level, examples include the use of  indocyanine green for immunofuorescent localisation of tumours as well as vascular, bronchial or lymphatic structures. When bound to plasma proteins, indocyanine green emits light with a peak wavelength of  around 820\u2013830\u00a0nm on illumination with near-infrared light. Through use of  a specifcally designed HD camera and software system with imposed pseudo-colour, \nareas of  difer ential tissue density and vascular supply can be \ndetected clearly without the need for digital palpation, thus facilitating complete resection and clear surgical margins. Its use is now well established in procedures such as minimal access liver, lung, renal and prostatic resections, and its role in other specialties such as colorectal surgery is also under investigation. The technology can be integrated into both video-assisted and robotic-assisted surgical procedures and is available within the da Vinci Xi and X robotic surgical systems as the Firefy\n\u00ae \nmode, which can be turned on as required from the surgical console (Figure 10.7). \nAnother role for augmented reality in minimal access sur -\ngery is the overlay of  imaging beside or directly onto the surgi-cal feld, \u2018navigating\u2019 the surgeon to the site of  interest without the need to look away from the patient to review imaging. Such navigational techniques originated in image-guided diagnos-tics, enabling identifca tion of  pathology in areas more difcult \nto reach anatomically. Through increasing adoption of  hybrid theatre complexes, these approaches ma y be utilised for both \ndiagnosis and treatment in a single setting. An example is the use of  navigational bronchoscopy to identify, diagnose and treat difcult to reach or small lung nodules. Preoperative planning CT scan is reconstructed by specialist software. The result is a 3D \u2018road map\u2019 of  the bronchial tree and a side-by-side picture of real-time endobronchial images with those from the imag-ing system (Figure 10.8).

The surgeon is then guided directly along the airway to the lesion of interest that can be biopsied with on-site frozen section.

Although the majority of  applications remain in the realm of  simulation and training, the promise of  real-time image guidance by means of  multiplanar or imaging over lay of  the surgeon\u2019s view is par -\nticularly attractive. Head-mounted displays may also provide data display or communication tools, reducing the need for the surgeon to look away from the operative feld and allow real-time guidance by a trainer or pr octor.

Indeed, both videoscopic \nand robotic platforms now have established simulation pro-grams that are a prerequisite for surgical trainees. Modern robotic simulation modules are able to create an environment that mirrors console use (face validity) and subsequently pro-\nvide hierarchical training compatible with the user\u2019s expertise. The combination of  simulation with profciency-based \u2018mas-tery\u2019 training may be the key to optimising the impact that sim-ulation may have on the sur gical learning curve and remains \nthe subject of  research in a range of  surgical specialties. \nWith widespread uptake of  minimal access surgery, train-\nees are now facing a new pr oblem owing to lack of  experience \nin open surgery. Surgeons must have sufcient open surgical \nexperience to feel comfortable converting cases in the ev ent \nof  difculty or emergency. A minimal access approach to a particular procedure may difer signifcantly in the order of operative steps and dissection technique. It is therefore vital that the new generation of  surgeons continues to receive train-ing in open surgery so that they can apply either technique as appropriate. \nAdvances in robotic surgery lend themselves to further \nAI integration, with potential advantages such as providing enhanced clinical decision support, warning of  de viations \nfrom optimal workfow or detecting and over laying potentially \nat-risk structures. In this way, artifcially intelligent systems may streamline procedural technique, reduce error and improve patient outcomes. Intelligent operating theatres may provide automated optimisation of  a wide range of  ergonomic features such as table positioning, lighting and temperature, further facilitating procedural efciency and efectiveness. In turn, more advanced artifcial systems may also develop a degree of supervised autonomy whereby basic surgical procedures can be independently performed by the robotic system. Indeed, in a preclinical setting, the STAR (Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot) robotic system has demonstrated superiority over human surgeons in porcine bowel anastomosis. \nTranslation of  such laboratory-based e xperiments to real-\nworld surgery is not simple. Application requires detailed understanding of  surgical workfow and integra tion of  com-\nplex data. To provide a fully comprehensive, annotated train-ing data set on which deep learning may be established, all devices and systems in the dynamic operating environment must be integrated, including operating room set-up, tool and camera usage and the variab le patient and procedural factors. \nIn addition there are complex questions in terms of  data pro-tection and confdentiality, not to mention the ethical consider -\nations and accountability of  autonomous or semi-autonomous robotic surgeons. The most promising elements of  AI inte-gration into minimal access surgery remain enhanced object detection, speech recognition, video characterisation and \ninteg ration with next-generation technologies. Real-time met-\nabolic pr ofling and tissue-level diagnosis may diferentiate \nbetween cancerous and non-cancerous tissues on the basis of \ntheir metabolic signature. An example is the iKnife, w hich uses \na rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometric (REIMS) technique to report tissue histology in real time by analysing aerosolised tissue during electrosurgical dissection. \nArtifcially intelligent systems also hold potential to dramat-\nically improve the fdelity of  simulation training in minimal access surgery, through the creation of  a \u2018real-world\u2019 training environment based on the vast data accrued in their develop -\nment.

The development of the light micro-scope allowed closer examination of  tissue from autopsies and surgical procedures, with visualisation of  cells, nuclei and tissue structure. Microscopic diagnosis was initially controversial, partly as a result of  the \u2018Kaiser\u2019s cancer\u2019 (a histological diag-\nnosis by Virchow of  a non-malignant laryngeal lesion, after which Kaiser Friedrich III died of  laryngeal malignancy), but the medical and surgical community eventually accepted its value. \nTissue analysis is now an integ ral and routine element of \nclinical practice. It is heavily dependent on microscopic assess-ment, although newer methods of tissue analysis will increas-\ningly provide additional information. Assessment of  tissue is \nusually the responsibility of  a histopathologist/cellular pathol-\nogist (a medically qualifed practitioner), who depends on \nsupport from technical staf. In the UK, the staf responsible \nfor tissue processing and the production of  sections on glass \nslides are known as biomedical scientists (BMSs). The specialty variably known as Histopatholog y , Anatomic Pathology or \nCellular Pathology encompasses histopathology , cytopathol-ogy , autopsy work and molecular tissue diagnosis. \nDevelopments and changes in cellular pathology are con-\ntinuous. The volume of  biopsies continues to increase as a result of  increasing clinical demands, expectations of  greater diagnostic precision, widespread fexible endoscopy and an ageing population with a higher pr evalence of  cancer and \nother illnesses. Cancer screening programmes also have an impact as they often depend heavily on cellular pathology . New techniques to refne histological assessment require addi-tional resources. There is an increasing obligation to comply To be aware of: \n\u2022 The principles of microscopic diagnosis \n\u2022 The features of neoplasia \n\u2022 The importance of clinicopathological correlation \n\u2022 The role of additional techniques, including special stains, \nimmunohistochemistry and molecular pathology \nwith national or international standards of  reporting, e.g. for \ncancer, and participation by pathologists in multidisciplinary team meetings is now routine rather than occasional. Other developments may reduce activity . Newer, less invasive meth-ods may replace tissue analysis, e.g. human papilloma virus (HPV) testing for cervical pre-neoplastic lesions is replacing cytological assessment. New methods in imaging may reduce the need for tissue analysis. \nThe location of  a modern cellular pathology department \nis usually within or near a medium-sized or lar ge hospital or \nin a purpose-built of-site centre. Typically , more than 80% of \nspecimens are from the gastrointestinal tract, gynaecological tract, skin or urological system. In line with clinical services, highly specialised work such as neuropathology takes place in major regional centres. Consolidation of  clinical services may result in reconfguration of  relevant pathology services and molecular testing facilities. \nREASONS FOR ASSESSMENT OF \nTISSUE \nThe contributions that tissue analysis makes to clinical \nmanagement include diagnosis, staging, prediction of  outcome and assistance with selection of  therapy . These are often interrelated. The process of  tissue assessment may make a new diagnosis or may confrm or refute a suspected or existing clinical diagnosis. There may be pointers towards a cause. Analysis may also reveal additional diagnoses that may be unsuspected. \nAs an example, pathological assessment of  an appendicec-\ntomy specimen most often confrms a suspected clinical diag-nosis of  acute appendicitis.

Similarly , biopsies from a patient with infammatory bowel disease may confrm the diagnosis but may sometimes reveal or suggest an alternative cause of  intestinal infammation such as tuberculo-sis, amoebiasis, ischaemia or mucosal prolapse. \nSummary box 11.1 \nReasons for analysis of tissue \n\u25cf Diagnosis \n\u25cf Confrmation/rejection of a clinical diagnosis \n\u25cf Additional diagnoses \n\u25cf Classifcation of neoplasia \n\u25cf Classifcation of non-neoplastic disease \n\u25cf Staging of malignancy \n\u25cf Prognosis \n\u25cf Management \n\u25cf Selection of therapy \n\u25cf Assessment of response to treatment \n\u25cf Cancer screening programmes and related programmes \n\u25cf Cervical, bowel, breast, infammatory bowel disease, \nBarrett\u2019s oesophagus \n\u25cf Clinical trial support \n\u25cf Audit \nTissue analysis also helps, increasingly , to determine or \nrefne treatment and prognosis. For example, the assessment of \na breast, lung, colorectal or other major cancer resection spec-imen helps to confrms the diagnosis but, more importantly , provides crucial information about features such as tumour stage, vascular invasion, perineural invasion and resection mar -\ngin involv ement, which in turn help to predict clinical outcome \nand determine postoperative treatment. The degree of  tumour regression in a resection after neoadjuvant therapy may also \nhave prognostic value. Additionally , pathological assessment of resections helps surgeons and radiologists to audit their accu-racy and performance. \nMolecular pathological analysis of  cancer tissue (see \nDiagnostic molecular pathology) increasingly contributes to management, including diagnostic categorisation, prognos-tic predictions and selection of drug therapy . The molecular \ntest or group of  tests that an oncologist chooses depends on patient status, tumour location, tumour morphology and stage, among other factors. The identifcation of a particular bio-\nmarker may provide an indication for targeted therapy . For example, detection of  high microsatellite instability (MSI) in metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC) may predict respon-siveness to immune checkpoint inhibition. Of course, a tissue sample does not represent the entire \npatient. Correlation with the clinical picture and the macro-scopic fndings enhances the interpretation of  pathological changes considerably . Ther efore, absence of  relevant details \nmay cause unnecessary delays and even er rors. For example, \nradiation therapy can have profound efects on tissue morphol-ogy , including mimicry of  other infammatory conditions or neoplasia. Accordingly , a request form with adequate informa-tion should accompany all specimens. Examples of  important \ndetails include site of  biopsy/resection, clinical setting, reasons for the procedure, patient details, medications, relevant risk \nfactors and past medical and surgical history , including pre-\nvious chemotherapy and radiotherapy . A request form stating \u2018cancer\u2019 or \u2018Crohn\u2019s\u2019 is better than a form with no details but is clearly not sufcient. \nFor small and large resection specimens, good quality mac -\nroscopic assessment and sampling is an important precursor to microscopic assessment (see Specimen processing). \nTISSUE SPECIMENS \nRoutine tissue specimens received by a histopathology depart-ment include those intended for histopathological analysis and those for cytopathological assessment. These may overlap, and \u2018cytology\u2019 preparations sometimes undergo reprocessing to become histological specimens. \nHistology \nSpecimens for histology are classifed as biopsies and resec-tions, although strictly speaking all samples are biopsies.

For example, some tumour biopsies may contain insufcient tumour for molecular testing. Of  course, correct diagnosis and grading are essential before molecular testing occurs, and attempts to bypass this step and take tissue for molecular testing without including the ste p of  histological \nassessment run many unnecessary risks such as absence of tumour in the sample or the presence of  a tumour that is dif-ferent from that expected clinically . \nAll samples for routine histology are immediately placed in \na fxative, usually formalin (10% formaldehyde), by the surgical team or by other clinical staf to preserve morphology . T his \nusually happens before delivery to the pathology laboratory . \nCytology \nThere are various approaches to the procurement of  a cytol-ogy sample. Some samples are easy to obtain, e.g. urine and sputum, whereas others require more intervention. A conven-tional cervical smear is obtained by sampling the cervical trans-formation zone with a brush/br oom. Bronchial aspirates and \nwashings and bronchial, gastrointestinal and biliary brushings sample a relatively wide area and may therefore be useful for the diagnosis of  malignancy . \nFine-needle aspiration (FN A) cytology may sample accessi-\nble sites such as the breast, thyroid and superfcial lymph nodes, while ultrasound or CT guidance assists FNA from deeper and less accessible structures, e.g. liver, pancreas , kidney and lung. \nUltrasound-guided transbronchial FNA may allow sampling of  mediastinal masses and transmucosal FNA may be appro-priate for submucosal gastrointestinal lesions or perivisceral lesions. A biopsy taken at the same procedure may accompany FNA cytology samples. Fluids may be submitted directly to the laboratory for cytological assessment. \nFresh tissue \nThe most common indication for submission of  a fresh tissue sample (i.e. without the usual formalin or any other fxative) is rapid frozen section diagnosis, usually done intraoperatively . Other indications are microbiological assessment, electron microscopy , chemical analyses (e.g. quantifcation of  iron in the tissue), research work, tissue banking and some types of molecular pathological analysis. \nRISK MANAGEMENT \nSafety and risk management are priorities in the labora-tory . The use of  warning labels helps to reduce the risk of contamination by transmissible infection, e.g. hepatitis B virus or human immunodefciency virus (HIV). This is especially important when submitting and handling fresh (unfxed) tissue . \nFormalin kills many microorganisms, but a risk of transmissible infection still requires notifcation. Also, formalin itself  is toxic to the eyes and skin. Accordingly , laboratory staf and indeed any staf should discard leaking or faulty specimen containers and deal immediately with formalin spillages. Patient details should be present on all specimen containers so as to avoid errors of  identity (Figure 11.1). Rigorous systems are in place to avoid interchange of specimens or confusion between difer -\nent patients\u2019 samples. \nFigure 11.1 Sections on glass slides stained with haematoxylin \nand eosin.
