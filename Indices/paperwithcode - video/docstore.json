you\u2019ll see in a moment.\nThese agents learn from previous experiences,\nand to the surprise of no one, for the first\nfew million rounds, we start out with\u2026pandemonium.\nEveryone just running around aimlessly.\nWithout proper strategy and semi-random movements,\nthe seekers are favored and hence win the\nmajority of the games.\nNothing to see here.\nThen, over time, the hiders learned to lock\nout the seekers by blocking the doors off\nwith these boxes and started winning consistently.\nI think the coolest part about this is that\nthe map was deliberately designed by the OpenAI\nscientists in a way that the hiders can only\nsucceed through collaboration.\nThey cannot win alone and hence, they are\nforced to learn to work together.\nWhich they did, quite well.\nBut then, something happened.\nDid you notice this pointy, doorstop-shaped\nobject?\nAre you thinking what I am thinking?\nWell, probably, and not only that, but about\n10 million rounds later, the AI also discovered\nthat it can be pushed near a wall and be used\nas a ramp, and, tadaa!\nGot\u2019em!\nTe seekers started winning more again.\nSo, the ball is now back on the court of the\nhiders.\nCan you defend this?\nIf so, how?\nWell, these resourceful little critters learned\nthat since there is a little time at the start\nof the game when the seekers are frozen, apparently,\nduring this time, they cannot see them, so\nwhy not just sneak out and steal the ramp,\nand lock it away from them.\nAbsolutely incredible.\nLook at those happy eyes as they are carrying\nthat ramp.\nAnd, you think it all ends here?\nNo, no, no.\nNot even close.\nIt gets weirder.\nMuch weirder.\nWhen playing a different map, a seeker has\nnoticed that it can use a ramp to climb on\nthe top of a box, and, this happens.\nDo you think couchsurfing is cool?\nGive me a break!\nThis is box surfing!\nAnd, the scientists were quite surprised by\nthis move as this was one of the first cases\nwhere the seeker AI seems to have broken the\ngame.\nWhat happens here is that the physics system\nis coded in a way that they are able to move\naround by exerting force on themselves, but,\nthere is no additional check whether they\nare on the floor or not, because who in their\nright mind would think about that?\nAs a result, something that shouldn\u2019t ever\nhappen does happen here.\nAnd, we\u2019re still not done yet, this paper\njust keeps on giving.\nA few hundred million rounds later, the hiders\nlearned to separate all the ramps from the\nboxes.\nDear Fellow Scholars, this is proper box surfing\ndefense\u2026then, lock down the remaining tools\nand build a shelter.\nNote how well rehearsed and executed this\nstrategy is - there is not a second of time\nleft until the seekers take off.\nI also love this cheeky move where they set\nup the shelter right next to the seekers,\nand I almost feel like they are saying \u201cyeah\nsee this here?\nthere is not a single thing you can do about\nit\u201d.\nIn a few isolated cases, other interesting\nbehaviors also emerged, for instance, the\nhiders learned to exploit the physics system\nand just chuck the ramp away.\nAfter that, the seekers go \u201cwhat?\u201d\n\u201cwhat just happened?\u201d.\nBut don\u2019t despair, and at this point, I\nwould also recommend that you hold on to your\npapers because there was also a crazy case\nwhere a seeker also learned to abuse a similar\nphysics issue and launch itself exactly onto\nthe top of the hiders.\nMan, what a paper.\nThis system can be extended and modded for\nmany other tasks too, so expect to see more\nof these fun experiments in the future.\nWe get to do this for a living, and we are\neven being paid for this.\nI can\u2019t believe it.\nIn this series, my mission is to showcase\nbeautiful works that light a fire in people.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4223, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9664bbb4-0574-41f7-8e04-2751a3799800": {"__data__": {"id_": "9664bbb4-0574-41f7-8e04-2751a3799800", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/ubuntu/ytscript/paperwithcode -
