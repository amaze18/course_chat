doing this but\none way hubman recommends is taking\naround 25 deep\nbreaths okay on a serious note I've been\ntrying this out for some time now and I\nhonestly think that the effects aren't\nthat noticeable for me because if I'm\ntired I'll just usually go for a walk or\nsome exercise because I feel like that's\nthe best way for me at least to become\nalert and actually focus on what I'm\ndoing but I can see how this can be\nhelpful if it's like really late and you\ncan't go out and exercise so I guess it\nreally depends on your own body clock\nand your own routine the next step is\nget focused now if you're anything like\nme you probably know that focusing is a\ngood thing it will help us learn much\nquicker but it's always so hard to do\nand this is exactly why I found this\nlittle trick quite useful hubman says\npick a point in the room to stare at for\naround 30 to 60 seconds he says you can\nblink but try not to have any other\nthoughts and just try and focus on that\none point until the time's up now this\nthis has to be one of my favorite tips\nbecause it seems so simple this one but\nit actually works really well and this\nis especially right after I stare at a\npoint and then go straight to work it's\nalmost as if you can carry the focus\nbetween one thing and the other and once\nI'm in the zone hubman recommends\nlimiting each study session to a Max of\n90 minutes and this is essentially\nbecause 90 minutes is about the maximum\ntime that we can maintain intense Focus\nfor and for me the goal when I sit down\nis to do at least 60 minutes because\noften lose focus but now I know if that\nhappens I use it as an excuse to take\none of those 10-second breaks that we\nmentioned before to kind of reset now\neven after you finished studying

you can do to\nmake sure you actually remember what you\njust learned and you saw me falling\nasleep in the intro that wasn't just for\ndramatic effect well it kind of was but\nit was also to show you the power of\nnsdr non-sleep deep rest and this\ninvolves things like meditation or\nnapping for around 20 minutes but\npersonally I find that I don't have that\nmuch time to rest after each study\nsession but luckily hubben says that\neven sitting there and doing nothing for\n1 minute but ideally 5 to 10 can have a\nsimilar effect as well now I'll be\nhonest it's very hard to measure how\neffective this is in helping me study\nbecause there's just not many\nquantitative ways to go about measuring\nit but one thing I've been doing this\nwith is with physical skills so learning\nkicks for my thae or driving a\nparticular route I find that after\npracticing these physical movements and\nthen doing nothing I find that this\nactually helps me remember them much\nbetter but obviously the actual sleep\nthat you get that night contributes to\nthis as well but basically for physical\nskills I found this very helpful and for\nmental skills like doing math or\nstudying I'm going to keep testing this\nout and see how it works in the long run\nand out of all of these steps hubin says\nthat getting alert getting focused and\nsleep that night are the most essential\nsteps but as for how you go about each\none it obviously depends on your own\nstyle and routine and personally for me\nfocusing on that one point to help me\nget focused and taking those 10c breaks\nduring my study sessions those were two\nof the things that I found the most\nhelpful and something that I've\nimplemented every day now and if you're\ninterested in the other study
