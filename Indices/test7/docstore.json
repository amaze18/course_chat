Such a generation process inevitably requires\nreference from the original melody, chord progression,\nor other structural information. Despite some promising\nmodels for arrangement, they lack more re\ufb01ned data to\nachieve better evaluations and more practical results. In\nthis paper, we propose POP909, a dataset which contains\nmultiple versions of the piano arrangements of 909 popular\nsongs created by professional musicians. The main body\nof the dataset contains the vocal melody, the lead instru-\nment melody, and the piano accompaniment for each song\nin MIDI format, which are aligned to the original audio\n\ufb01les. Furthermore, we provide the annotations of tempo,\nbeat, key, and chords, where the tempo curves are hand-\nlabeled and others are done by MIR algorithms. Finally,\nwe conduct several baseline experiments with this dataset\nusing standard deep music generation algorithms.\n1 Introduction\nMusic arrangement, the process of reconstructing and re-\nconceptualizing a piece, can refer to various conditional\nmusic generation tasks, which includes accompaniment\ngeneration conditioned on a lead sheet (the lead melody\nwith a chord progression) [1\u20134], transcription and re-\norchestration conditioned on the original audio [5\u20137], and\nreduction of a full score so that the piece can be performed\nby a single (or fewer) instrument(s) [8,9].

The ar-\nrangements are in MIDI format, aligned to the lead melody\n(also in MIDI format) and the original audios. Further-\nmore, each song are provided with manually labeled tempo\ncurves and machine-extracted beat, key and chord labels\nusing music information retrieval algorithms. We hope our\ndataset can help with future research in automated music\narrangement, especially task 1and 2indicated in Fig-\nure 1:\nTask 1: Piano accompaniment generation condi-\ntioned on paired melody and auxiliary annotation. This\ntask involves learning the intrinsic relations between\nmelody and accompaniment, including the selection of\naccompaniment \ufb01gure, the creation of counterparts and\nsecondary melody, etc.\nTask 2: Re-orchestration from audio , i.e., the gener-\nation of piano accompaniment based on the audio of a\nfull orchestra.\nBesides those main tasks, our dataset can also be used for\nunconditional symbolic music generation, expressive per-\nformance rendering, etc.\n2 Related Work\nIn this section, we begin with a discussion of different\nmodalities of music data in Section 2.1. We then review\nsome existing composition-related datasets in Section 2.2\nand summarize the requirements of a quali\ufb01ed arrange-\nment dataset in Section 2.3. Again, our focus is piano\narrangement and this dataset is designed for task 1and\n2indicated in Figure 1, i.e., piano accompaniment gen-\neration based on the lead melody or the original audio.\n2.1 Modalities of Music Generation\nAs discussed in [22], music data is intrinsically multi-\nmodal and most generative models focus on one modality.\nIn speci\ufb01c, music generation can refer to: 1) score gen-\neration [23\u201326], which deals with the very abstract sym-\nbolic representation, 2) performance rendering [4, 19, 20],\n1The dataset is available at https://github.com/music-x-lab/POP909-\nDatasetwhich regards music as a sequence of controls and usually\ninvolves timing and dynamics nuances, and 3) audio syn-\nthesis [27, 28], which considers music as a waveform or\nspectrogram. The POP909 dataset is targeted for arrange-\nment generation in the modality of score and performance.\n2.2 Existing Datasets\nTable 1 summarizes the existing music datasets which are\nthe potential resources for the piano arrangement genera-\ntion tasks. The \ufb01rst column shows the dataset name, and\nthe other columns show some important properties of each\ndataset.\nLakh MIDI [13] is one of the most popular datasets in\nsymbolic format, containing 176,581 songs in MIDI for-\nmat from a broad range of genres. Most songs have multi-\nple tracks, most of which are aligned to the original audio.\nHowever, the dataset does not mark the lead melody track\nor the piano accompaniment track and therefore cannot be\ndirectly used for piano arrangement.\nMaestro [15] and E-piano [29] contains classical pi-\nano performances in time-aligned MIDI and audio formats.\nHowever, the boundary between the melody and accom-\npaniment is usually ambiguous for classical compositions.\nConsequently, the dataset is not suitable for the arrange-\nment task 1. Moreover, the MIDI \ufb01les are transcription\nrather than re-harmonization of the audio, which makes it\ninappropriate for the arrangement task 2either.\nNottingham Database [18] is a high-quality resource of\nBritish and Irish folk songs.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4016, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8c33d2a-b97c-453a-b8ea-6756825c4745": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8c33d2a-b97c-453a-b8ea-6756825c4745", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 585069, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20", "entities": ["Nottingham Database"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9be7b1b9-b053-4ce1-99c2-e75b19941737", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 585069, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20"}, "hash": "2e398625c740a5b42beab6c1fa8d9be225ad5ab15e53e7bf23ffa435dbe9df59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5fbe3f0e-7490-4d6a-9e5c-c09a2fdc513c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 585069, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20"}, "hash": "7764ecc6154df65d35c50796b5f2f2244319c05b547e50a2a3c58a1d0f6b6a4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee26554d-be00-4a77-a0db-b69e9c20f1b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6246103e376204757b812756fb92731972d11c7fc5e4eaafa8058652a01912b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, the boundary between the melody and accom-\npaniment is usually ambiguous for classical compositions.\nConsequently, the dataset is not suitable for the arrange-\nment task 1.

The arrangements are time-aligned to the corre-\nsponding audios and maintain the original style and tex-\nture. Extra annotation includes beat, chord, and key infor-\nmation.\n3.1 Data Collection Process\nWe hire professional musicians to create piano arrange-\nments. In order to maintain a high-quality standard of the\narrangements, we divide the musicians into two teams: the\narranger team and the reviewer team . The collection is \ufb01-\nnalized through an iterative procedure between two teams.\nFor each song, each iteration goes through three steps:\n1. Arrangement: the arranger team creates an arrangement\nfrom scratch, or revise the previous version of arrange-\nment.\n2. Review: the reviewer team decides whether the current\nversion is quali\ufb01ed and comments on how to improve\nthe arrangement in case further revisions are required.\n3. Discussion: musicians from both teams catch up with\nthe progress, discuss and improve details of arrangement\nstandards.\nWe start the process from a list of 1000 popular songs\nand \ufb01nally select 909 songs with high arrangement qual-\nity. We not only present the last revision (i.e., the quali-\n\ufb01ed version) of each song but also provide the unquali\ufb01ed\nversions of each song created during the iterative process.\nThis multi-version feature may potentially offer a broader\napplication scenario of the dataset.\n3.2 Data Content and Format\nIn POP909, the total duration of 909 arrangements is about\n60 hours. The songs are composed by 462 artists. The\nrelease of all songs spans around 60 years (from the earliest\nin 1950s to the latest around 2010).\nEach piano arrangement is stored in MIDI format with\nthree tracks. Figure 2 shows an example of a three-track\nMIDI \ufb01le, in which different tracks are labeled with differ-\nent colors. The three tracks are:\nFigure 2 : An example of the MIDI \ufb01le in a piano roll view.\nDifferent colors denote different tracks (red for MELODY ,\nyellow for BRIDGE, and green for PIANO).\n\u2022MELODY: the lead (vocal) melody transcription.\n\u2022BRIDGE: the arrangement of secondary melodies or\nlead instruments.\n\u2022PIANO: the arrangement of main body of the accompa-\nniment, including broken chords, arpeggios, and many\nother textures.\nHere, the combination of BRIDGE and PIANO track\nforms the piano accompaniment arrangement of the origi-\nnal song. Each MIDI \ufb01le is aligned with the original audio\nby manually labeled tempo curve. Moreover, each note\nevent contains expressive dynamics (i.e., detailed velocity\ncontrol) based on the original audio.\nBeat, chord, and key annotations are provided in \ufb01ve\nseparate text \ufb01les for each song. Annotations for beat\nand chord have both MIDI and audio versions while key\nchanges annotations are merely extracted from audios.2\nThe relevant music information retrieval algorithms are\ndiscussed in Section 4.\n3.3 Data Folder Structure\nFigure 3 demonstrates the folder structure of POP909. In\nthe root directory, there are 909 folders, corresponding to\n909 songs. In each folder, we provide the MIDI format\narrangement, text format annotations, and a folder of all\narrangement versions produced during the iterative pro-\ncesses.\nThe annotation \ufb01les contain beat, chord and key anno-\ntations in plain text format. Table 2 shows the partial anno-\ntations of the song 003 in table format for better illustra-\ntion purposes. For the beat annotation, beat_audio and\nbeat_midi are the annotation \ufb01les extracted from audio\nand MIDI, respectively. The source of chord and key an-\nnotations are indicated in a similar way.\n2For annotations from MIDI \ufb01les, the quali\ufb01ed (\ufb01nal) version of ar-\nrangements is used.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4314, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aece27f8-554a-436a-a5f1-b6fef4f3ae7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "aece27f8-554a-436a-a5f1-b6fef4f3ae7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 585069, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eddaddf4-8093-4eea-a753-d0ac3b8f1b1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 585069, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20"}, "hash": "6c4f7e11458ccfad001d58c2e51447a23f8b434a8a896a75f1a15a02b1756ae3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee26554d-be00-4a77-a0db-b69e9c20f1b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 585069, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20"}, "hash": "81d17278f32c7d95e17460f612176152e94519d22392154a42deec38f91b0c2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "76544e58-7a55-4707-ba42-c8d622f98e8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ef8876afc076518bf9eacb6703390271132c70d0b6602bfb7508787f05301d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "POP909\nSong 001 Song 002 Song 909\nversions\n001-v3.midbeat_audio.txt beat_midi.txt......\nchord_audio.txt chord_midi.txt key_audio.txt\n001-v1.mid 001-v2.mid001.midIndex FileFigure 3 : The folder structure of POP909.

For each of the three tasks, different\nalgorithms are applied to extract information from MIDI\nor audio.\n4.1 Beat & Downbeat Estimation\nWe \ufb01rst extract beat information from MIDI \ufb01les by tak-\ning advantage of two features of the MIDI performance:\n(1) human-annotated tempo curves, and (2) the accompa-\nniment \ufb01gure of arrangements which shows a signi\ufb01cant\nsign of beat and downbeat attacks.\nOur method can be seen as a modi\ufb01cation of the beat-\ntracking algorithms used in [30, 31]. First, we estimate the\ninitial beat position and use the tempo curve to deduce sub-\nsequent beat positions. Second, we estimate the number of\nbeats in a measure by calculating the auto-correlation of\nthe extracted beat features (MIDI onset and velocity), as-\nsuming time signature is in general consistent within one\nsong except for some infrequent phase changes. Finally,\nwe search among all the possible phase shifts and \ufb01nd the\noptimal beat track that has the highest correlation with the\nextracted features.\nWe also provide the beat and downbeat annotations ex-\ntracted from the audio using the algorithm introduced in\n[32] and compare them with the annotations extracted from\nMIDI.\nFor beat position estimation, the two algorithms have\nmore than 90% consistency when the maximum error tol-\nerance is 100 ms, which is acceptable in the data collection\nprocess. For downbeat estimation, the two algorithms have\n80% agreement. We provide both extraction results in our\nannotation \ufb01les.4.2 Chord Label Extraction\nWe also provide the chord labels extracted from both MIDI\nand audio \ufb01les. For the audio chord recognition, we adopt a\nlarge-vocabulary chord transcription algorithm by [33]. As\nchord changes in popular music are most likely to happen\nat beat positions, we post-process the chord boundaries by\naligning them to beats to produce the \ufb01nal chord labels.\n\ufb01le beat time downbeat_1 downbeat_2\nbeat_midi0.02\n0.75\n1.49\n2.22\n2.95\n3.68\n...1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n...0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n...\n\ufb01le beat time beat order\nbeat_audio1.46\n2.18\n2.92\n3.66\n...1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n...\n\ufb01le start time end time chord\nchord_midi0.02\n0.75\n1.49\n4.41\n...0.75\n1.49\n4.41\n7.34\n...N\nN\nG:min7\nEb:sus2\n...\n\ufb01le start time end time chord\nchord_audio0.00\n2.46\n4.39\n...1.46\n4.39\n7.31\n...N\nG:min7\nEb:maj(9)\n...\n\ufb01le start time end time key\nkey_audio 1.46 226.00 Bb:maj\nTable 2 : The \ufb01rst several lines of the annotation \ufb01les\nfor song 003. \u201cdownbeat_1\u201d and \u201cdownbeat_2\u201d in\nbeat_midi are the two downbeat extractors under sim-\nple meter and compound meter assumptions, respectively.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3080, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76544e58-7a55-4707-ba42-c8d622f98e8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "76544e58-7a55-4707-ba42-c8d622f98e8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 585069, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20", "entities": ["maj", "min"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3b86b551-7664-4d7d-ae59-cad5799b6d7f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 585069, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20"}, "hash": "986eb66e08098e53b4a424a20422e47c36609d59e50221918e60f5782d890b3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aece27f8-554a-436a-a5f1-b6fef4f3ae7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/2008.07142.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 585069, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20"}, "hash": "6c4f7e11458ccfad001d58c2e51447a23f8b434a8a896a75f1a15a02b1756ae3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d05c30b5-8bb7-4914-a060-6db7c2f105a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a197685cc139a8b150b3ff14abd53ceda3dc9b669dc871754133a11df2ac7b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For MIDI chord recognition, we adopt a method sim-\nilar to the one proposed in [34]. We made two minor\nchanges based on the original algorithm. First, the chord\nsegmentation is performed on the beat level. Second, we\nalter the chord templates to include more chord qualities\nused by pop songs: (1) triads ( maj,min,dim,aug) with\ninversions, (2) basic sevenths ( maj7 ,min7 ,7,dim7 ,\nhdim7 ) with inversions, (3) suspended chords ( sus2 ,\nsus4 ,sus4(b7) ), and (4) sixth chords ( maj6 ,min6 ).\nNote that the arrangement and its original audio may\nhave different chord progressions. For example, a C:maj\nchord may be arranged into C:sus2 , if necessary. There-\nfore, both annotations are reasonable and they are not nec-\nessarily consistent with each other. To compare the extrac-\ntion accuracy, we compute the matching rate of the root\nnotes of the chords extracted from both methods. Results\nshow that the matching degree of more than 800 songs in\nPOP909 are above 75%. On the other hand, there are still\na few songs whose matching degrees are below 40%. The\nmain reasons are: (1) some of these audio recordings are\nslightly out of tune, and (2) some parts of the audio have\ncomplicated sound effects, in which case our teams decide\nto re-arrange the chord progression.\n4.3 Key Signature Extraction\nWe also provide key signature annotation from the audio\n\ufb01les. We adopt an algorithm very similar to [35]. The orig-\ninal algorithm performs the key classi\ufb01cation for a whole\nsong based on the averaged frame-wise feature. In our\nmodi\ufb01ed algorithm, we also allow key changes in the mid-\ndle of the song using a median \ufb01lter to post-process the\nframe-level labels.\n5 Experiments\nIn this section, we conduct two baseline experiments\non music (score-modality) generation with the POP909\ndataset: 1) polyphonic music generation (without melody\ncondition), and 2) piano arrangement generation condi-\ntioned on melody. For both tasks, we use the Transformer\narchitecture [36] for its advantages in capturing long-term\ndependencies on time-series data.\n5.1 Polyphonic Music Generation\nWe use a transformer encoder with relative positional en-\ncoding [19, 37] to model the distribution of polyphonic\nmusic. We adopt a MIDI-like event-based representation\nslightly modi\ufb01ed from [19, 38] to encode the polyphonic\nmusic. Each piece of music is represented as a series of\nevents, including note onsets, offsets, velocity changes,\nand time shifts. We further quantize time shifts tokens un-\nder the resolution of1\n4beat. In total, we use 16 time-shift\nevents, ranging from1\n4beat to 4 beats. Longer notes or\nrests can be represented by multiple time-shift tokens in a\nsequence. Table 3 shows the details of our data representa-\ntion.\nWe split the dataset into 3 subsets: 90% for training, 5%\nfor validation, and 5% for testing.

It contains multiple versions of\nprofessional piano arrangements in MIDI format of 909\npopular songs, together with precise tempo curve aligned\nto the original audio recordings. We also provide annota-\ntions of tempo, beat, downbeat, key, and chord labels. To\nguarantee a high data quality, the dataset was collected viathe collaboration of two groups of professional musicians,\narrangers and reviewers, in an interactive process. Apart\nfrom the arrangement problem, the POP909 dataset serves\nas a high-quality resource for structural music generation\nand cross-modal music generation.\n7 References\n[1] I. Simon, D.

Then I recorded the confession statement of the accused in their presence which runs as follows. \n\n\"My Name is Mahankali Satthibabu @ Pandu S/o Suribabu, Age: 28 Years, Caste: Kapu, Occupation: Compressor Driller, Address: Darjeenagar Village, Bavuluwada Panchayat, N/o Wooderu Village, Anakapalli Mandal and District, Cell No. : 9182739995, 7780188543. I don't need a lawyer when the police are interrogating me. I used to stay in Vijayawada along with my wife and children since last 3 years and used to do labor work, about 10 months ago today I and my wife and children came back from Vijayawada to our own village Darjinagar village. I have bad habits like drinking drugs and chasing girls., I have done murders in Anakapalli and Chodavaram areas in the past and also used to threaten and beat up those who opposed me and if needed by my acquaintances, took money from them and beat up and threatened those who opposed them. So I always have a knife with me. But some time ago I got acquainted with a girl named Keerthi who lives in Chodavaram Kotaveedhi. I used to call Kirti and talk to her with the intention of feeling it physically. Kirti used to talk to me very well in the beginning. Later, when I called, I used to hang up and switch off. I came to know that she is close to Madireddy Hemant @ Sai in Chodavaram and not me. That's why I decided to see the end of Madireddy Sai. On 05-10-2023 evening around 06-30 PM I called Keerti, Keerti was not talking to me properly like before. I was very angry about that. I decided to kill Madireddy Hemant @ Sai as well as Keerthi because Keerthy was not paying attention to me because she was getting close to Madireddy Hemant @ Sai and not me. Later I called my friend Bommarillu Chiranjeevi S/o Durga Rao of Duddupalem village and asked him to come, after some time Chiranjeevi came to me in Darjinagar. While we both were drinking alcohol  together, I told Chiranjeevi about fame and decided to kill Madireddy Hemant@Sai and asked for his help, to which Chiranjeevi agreed, after that I and Chiranjeevi left Darjinagar on my bike on my way to Chodavaram and reached Venkannapalem. Both of us did not think that our friend Ekula Likhit s/o Nagabhushanam would also come to work for us, so we asked Ekula Likhit to come to our aid as well.", "start_char_idx": 21384, "end_char_idx": 24840, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68caa90c-f41d-426b-8044-50423527e854": {"__data__": {"id_": "68caa90c-f41d-426b-8044-50423527e854", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 48032, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20", "entities": ["Chodavaram", "Nagabhushanam", "Madireddy Hemant", "Ekula Likhit", "Likhit", "Keerthy", "Kirti", "Kota veedhi"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "934f888d-122e-48cf-b94f-40b0c801099e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 48032, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20"}, "hash": "f7d2a51fa23fa760220c4285f5784405d18a22eb9390ab3e0c6ca86479a793bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6384077-abfb-40a8-9a1a-807fb60aa2e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 48032, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20"}, "hash": "fd6293e4c0d41d33955776f08bf449099e9715d2945a88ad8c8886337f76e11d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5be60cd2-3626-43a9-93df-c6a9d365cce2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9dbe49e0f465f7ac1940751d6b8bfc1e1e7301f0cf95c61085f12901bfcb221", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Both of us did not think that our friend Ekula Likhit s/o Nagabhushanam would also come to work for us, so we asked Ekula Likhit to come to our aid as well. So that night at around 11 o'clock we three reached Chodavaram and searched for Madireddy Hemant@Sai and Kirti, but we didn't know where they were, when I called Kirti, Kirti's phone switched off. On that we went to his house on Kota veedhi about Kirti and she was not at home. After some time Likhit calls Keerthy from his phone, she picks up the phone and says I am outside and hangs up. Then Likhit told me that Keerthy might be staying in Sai\u2019s room with her new boyfriend Madireddy Hemant @ Sai, we three searched for Sai and Keerthy in known places in Chodavaram, finally at around 11.30 pm they both went to Sai's room which is at the back side of Gayatri hospital. I came to know that Keerti and Sai and another girl were in Sai's room together, Chiranjeevi and Likhit were guarded outside the room, I went into Sai's room and saw that Sai was there along with Keerti and a girl named Swati. I didn't think this was good and tried to pull Kirti out first, Sai got on top of me and called someone to come urgently. Meanwhile some people from Sai came there. Seeing that there was no use, I decided to attack and kill those who came in the way with the knife that I had carefully kept in front of me, and also asked my friends Chiranjeevi and Likhit to help me. Thus both of them were helping me and not attacking me suddenly, not from behind, turning on them if someone came, Sai's friend Vedula Raju was preventing Sai from doing anything, I was poked the knife on his stomach and chest with the intention of killing the said Vedula Raju. I attacked with my knife in two places. I also got an injury on my nose in this fight. Meanwhile, as more people came around, we decided that there was no use and we will see about them later, from there I and my two friends ran away and went to Chodavaram Government Hospital.After first aid treatment there, the doctor referred me to NTR hospital in Anakapalli, Chiranjeevi took me to Usha prime hospital in Anakapalli and joined me. Later, while I was being treated at Anakapalli Usha Prime Hospital, Chodavaram Police came and recorded my statement and registered a case against it. Also, knowing that Vedula Raju, who was injured in my attack, had filed a case against me in Chodavaram police station, I escaped from the hospital and fled to Vijayawada as the police would arrest me as well. I have been there for many months. Chodavaram police were looking for me even there, so I ran away for many years without anyone finding me. Meanwhile, the Anakapalli Court has issued an arrest warrant against me in the murder case against me in Anakapalli Rural Police Station. For that, Anakapalli Rural Police arrested me and sent me to Visakhapatnam Central Jail. After that Chodavaram Police took production warrant against me from Chodavaram Court and executed it, took police custody from Chodavaram Court and brought me today from Visakhapatnam Central Jail to Chodavaram Police Station and asked me about the above crime and told me the above matters.\n\n            Then I asked Mahankali Satthibabu @ Pandu where is the knife you used in the crime that day, and he said that I put the knife that I used in the crime that day in the back wall of Chodavaram Gayatri Hospital. He said that he will show me the knife if he comes with me.\n\nThen I asked him whether you have committed any other crimes, he said that I, Gorli Bhanu @ Bhaneswara Rao of Bhimunigumm, Saladi Vasu of Makavaram village, Yugander (his town is unknown) Lamu along with one day in the month of July 2021 at around 11-00 hours while searching for a person named Nadigatla Gurunad near Mamidipalem, Anakapalli mandal, with the intention of killing him, his friend Manikanta was seen.", "start_char_idx": 24684, "end_char_idx": 28544, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5be60cd2-3626-43a9-93df-c6a9d365cce2": {"__data__": {"id_": "5be60cd2-3626-43a9-93df-c6a9d365cce2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 48032, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20", "entities": ["Chodavaram Mandal", "Chodavaram", "Duddupalem Village", "Chodavaram Police", "Gurunad", "Manikant", "Mahankali Satthibabu", "Gandhavaram"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "934f888d-122e-48cf-b94f-40b0c801099e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 48032, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20"}, "hash": "f7d2a51fa23fa760220c4285f5784405d18a22eb9390ab3e0c6ca86479a793bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "68caa90c-f41d-426b-8044-50423527e854", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/test7/273-2023 307 IPC.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 48032, "creation_date": "2024-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-20"}, "hash": "a5b44149b77b25a48030d9c0e5ed3f655d0902c038480212bea0c8e95ee6d986", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5f9f3cd8-d276-40ba-8baf-4304a55cdd8d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf5617760a88f7d42280c3704c37a304eb2936ee6e3d8b499ba329e36c72da4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "When Manikant was asked about Gurunad, he left without giving a proper answer, four of us took the said Manikanta on bikes and took him to the suburb of Gandhavaram village, Chodavaram mandal and beat him severely with sticks. Even then I came to know that the Chodavaram Police registered a case against us. In that case too, I was running away from the police as he said. \n\n           Then I identified the  Mahankali Satthibabu @ Pandu S/o Suribabu as accused A1, Bommarillu Chiranjeevi S/o Durga Rao, Duddupalem Village, Chodavaram Mandal as A2 accused , Ekula Likhit s/o Naga Bhushanam, Village Venkannapalem, Chodavaram Mandal has been identified as accused A3 in Crime No: 273/2023, U/S 307,323 R/w 34 IPC of Chodavaram.P.S. and also identified him as accused A-1 in Crime No: 279/2021, U/S 326 R/w 34 IPC of Chodavaram.P.S., Gorli Bhanu @ Bhaneswara Rao of Bhimuniguman as accused A2, Saladi Vasu of village Makavaram as accused A3, Ugander was identified as A4 accused.\n\nThen I arrested him in Crime No.: 273/2023, U/S 307,323 R/w 34 IPC and Crime No.: 279/2021, U/S 326 R/w 34 IPC. After informing about the crime committed, all the things he said were typed in Telugu language on the laptop and after they were printed out on the papers and the contents were read out to Mahankali Sattibabu @ Pandu in the presence of us, the mediators, we all signed and gave it after saying that everything was correct.\n\nThe above confession statement of the accused was recorded on 06.03.2024 from 13.00hrs to 14.30hrs.\n\nThen I followed the accused to the place of offence along with mediators as directed by him and then the accused showed the place where the offence taken place in this case and informed that he was kept the knife in the bushes situated at the back side of wall of Gayathri Hospital, Chodavaram and taken out the knife from the bushes and informed that on the night of 05-10-2023 he was attacked with this knife with the intention of killing the Vedula Raju.

The length of the blade is 5 cm.  and the plastic grip part is 7 \u00bd cm.\n\nThe purpose of Police custody was almost completed.

But some time ago I got acquainted with a girl named Keerthi who lives in Chodavaram Kotaveedhi. I used to call Kirti and talk to her with the intention of feeling it physically. Kirti used to talk to me very well in the beginning. Later, when I called, I used to hang up and switch off. I came to know that she is close to Madireddy Hemant @ Sai in Chodavaram and not me. That's why I decided to see the end of Madireddy Sai. On 05-10-2023 evening around 06-30 PM I called Keerti, Keerti was not talking to me properly like before. I was very angry about that. I decided to kill Madireddy Hemant @ Sai as well as Keerthi because Keerthy was not paying attention to me because she was getting close to Madireddy Hemant @ Sai and not me. Later I called my friend Bommarillu Chiranjeevi S/o Durga Rao of Duddupalem village and asked him to come, after some time Chiranjeevi came to me in Darjinagar. While we both were drinking alcohol  together, I told Chiranjeevi about fame and decided to kill Madireddy Hemant@Sai and asked for his help, to which Chiranjeevi agreed, after that I and Chiranjeevi left Darjinagar on my bike on my way to Chodavaram and reached Venkannapalem. Both of us did not think that our friend Ekula Likhit s/o Nagabhushanam would also come to work for us, so we asked Ekula Likhit to come to our aid as well. So that night at around 11 o'clock we three reached Chodavaram and searched for Madireddy Hemant@Sai and Kirti, but we didn't know where they were, when I called Kirti, Kirti's phone switched off. On that we went to his house on Kota veedhi about Kirti and she was not at home. After some time Likhit calls Keerthy from his phone, she picks up the phone and says I am outside and hangs up. Then Likhit told me that Keerthy might be staying in Sai\u2019s room with her new boyfriend Madireddy Hemant @ Sai, we three searched for Sai and Keerthy in known places in Chodavaram, finally at around 11.30 pm they both went to Sai's room which is at the back side of Gayatri hospital. I came to know that Keerti and Sai and another girl were in Sai's room together, Chiranjeevi and Likhit were guarded outside the room, I went into Sai's room and saw that Sai was there along with Keerti and a girl named Swati. I didn't think this was good and tried to pull Kirti out first, Sai got on top of me and called someone to come urgently. Meanwhile some people from Sai came there. Seeing that there was no use, I decided to attack and kill those who came in the way with the knife that I had carefully kept in front of me, and also asked my friends Chiranjeevi and Likhit to help me. Thus both of them were helping me and not attacking me suddenly, not from behind, turning on them if someone came, Sai's friend Vedula Raju was preventing Sai from doing anything, I was poked the knife on his stomach and chest with the intention of killing the said Vedula Raju. I attacked with my knife in two places. I also got an injury on my nose in this fight. Meanwhile, as more people came around, we decided that there was no use and we will see about them later, from there I and my two friends ran away and went to Chodavaram Government Hospital.After first aid treatment there, the doctor referred me to NTR hospital in Anakapalli, Chiranjeevi took me to Usha prime hospital in Anakapalli and joined me. Later, while I was being treated at Anakapalli Usha Prime Hospital, Chodavaram Police came and recorded my statement and registered a case against it. Also, knowing that Vedula Raju, who was injured in my attack, had filed a case against me in Chodavaram police station, I escaped from the hospital and fled to Vijayawada as the police would arrest me as well.
