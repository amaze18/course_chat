this video we continue with\nthe third part in the AI reading list\nseries which presents the 27 study inms\nthat ilas gave to John karmac back in\n2020 so make sure that you have already\nwatched the previous two parts before\ncontinuing with this video and if you\nalready did that let's get started the\nfirst item in the reading list is the\nmultiscale context aggregation by\ndilated convolutions which argued back\nin 2015 when this paper was written so\nit might be a little bit outdated that\ndense prediction problems such as\nsemantic segmentation rely to heavily on\nadaptations of convolutional neural\nnetworks that were originally designed\nfor image classification and thus they\nintroduced the dilated convolutions\nlayer which allows a faster expansion of\nthe CNN's receptive field without loss\nof resolution or coverage and since this\npaper was introduced dileted\nconvolutions have become quite popular\nand we can see them implemented in most\nof the major Frameworks we've got today\nso definitely read this one if you want\nto see how it began the next paper is\nquite an interesting one and it proposes\na message passing neuron Network that\ntries to predict the quantum properties\nof an organic molecule by modeling a DFT\ncalculation which to my understanding is\na very computationally expensive\ncalculation in quantum physics\nunfortunately that's all I have to say\nabout this paper since I am not at all\nfamiliar with this topic but if you find\nit interesting definitely give it a go I\nbelieve that the following paper\nrequires no introduction as well is the\nattention is all you need paper which\nintroduces the Transformer model and the\nself attention mechanism when this paper\nwas written the common approach for\nsequence to sequence problems like\nmachine translation or summarization was\nto use a recurrent neural network to\nencode the input and the recurrent\nneural network to decode the output\nbased on the information coming from the\nencoder then if you wanted to improve\nyour results you definitely would have\nalso use some kind of attention\nmechanism between the encoder and the\ndecoder what this paper did was to say\nno no no this is not how we should do it\nand we should instead drop the eron\ninting AL together and use only the\nattention mechanism which allows us to\ngreatly enhance the computational\nparallelism and the scalability of the\nmodel so yeah definitely read this one\nif you haven't already since the\nattention mechanism stands at the core\nof all modern AI models and again I also\nhave a video about this topic if you\nwant to get a better visual\nunderstanding and if the last paper was\nthe one that got rid of the recurent\nneural networks in sequest to sequest\nmodeling the next item in the reading\nlist was the one that added the\nattention mechanism to the record neural\nnetworks and is titled neural machine\ntranslation by jointly learning to align\nin translate so definitely read this\npaper if you want to get a better sense\nof how this mechanism works and why the\nauthors wanted to add the attention\nlayer in the first place to the encoder\ndecoder architecture moving on with the\nlast item on the reading list that we'll\ndiscuss in this video which is the\nidentity mappings in deep residual\nnetworks in this paper the author of the\nresidual blog goes even deeper with\nneural networks and he experiments with\nmodels that have like a thousand layers\nhe also argues that the original\nresidual block where you first do a\nconvolution then a batch Norm then a reu\nand then again a convolution and a batch\nNorm after which you add the input\nfeatures and apply a nonlinearity is not\nthe optimal way of using the residual\nblock and how we should stack instead\nthese layers would be to First apply a\nbatch Norm then a reu then the\nconvolution and then again a batch Norm\nA reu and A convolution and then add the\noutput to the input features and you can\nsee that we have also removed the\nnonlinearity here at the end and by\ndoing this we can observe in this figure\nthat the proposed residual block obtains\na much lower loss on both training and\ntesting compared to the original one I\nbelieve that this way of stacking the\nlayers in residual connections is still\nthe standard today so if you ever wonder\nwhy they are constructed like that take\na look at this paper and that's\nbasically it for the third part in the\nseries please hit the like button if you\nenjoy this video and please let

Title: OpenAI Plays Hide and Seek\u2026and Breaks The Game! \ud83e\udd16\n\nTranscript:\nWhile we look at the exact rules here, I will\nnote that the goal of the project was to pit\ntwo AI teams against each other, and hopefully\nsee some interesting emergent behaviors.\nAnd, boy, did they do some crazy stuff.\nThe coolest part is that the two teams compete\nagainst each other, and whenever one team\ndiscovers a new strategy, the other one has\nto adapt.\nKind of like an arms race situation, and it\nalso resembles generative adversarial network\na little.\nAnd the results are magnificent, amusing,\nweird - you\u2019ll see in a moment.\nThese agents learn from previous experiences,\nand to the surprise of no one, for the first\nfew million rounds, we start out with\u2026pandemonium.\nEveryone just running around aimlessly.\nWithout proper strategy and semi-random movements,\nthe seekers are favored and hence win the\nmajority of the games.\nNothing to see here.\nThen, over time, the hiders learned to lock\nout the seekers by blocking the doors off\nwith these boxes and started winning consistently.\nI think the coolest part about this is that\nthe map was deliberately designed by the OpenAI\nscientists in a way that the hiders can only\nsucceed through collaboration.\nThey cannot win alone and hence, they are\nforced to learn to work together.\nWhich they did, quite well.\nBut then, something happened.\nDid you notice this pointy, doorstop-shaped\nobject?\nAre you thinking what I am thinking?\nWell, probably, and not only that, but about\n10 million rounds later, the AI also discovered\nthat it can be pushed near a wall and be used\nas a ramp, and, tadaa!\nGot\u2019em!\nTe seekers started winning more again.\nSo, the ball is now back on the court of the\nhiders.\nCan you defend this?\nIf so, how?\nWell, these resourceful little critters learned\nthat since there is a little time at the start\nof the game when the seekers are frozen, apparently,\nduring this time, they cannot see them, so\nwhy not just sneak out and steal the ramp,\nand lock it away from them.\nAbsolutely incredible.\nLook at those happy eyes as they are carrying\nthat ramp.\nAnd, you think it all ends here?\nNo, no, no.\nNot even close.\nIt gets weirder.\nMuch weirder.\nWhen playing a different map, a seeker has\nnoticed that it can use a ramp to climb on\nthe top of a box, and, this happens.\nDo you think couchsurfing is cool?\nGive me a break!\nThis is box surfing!\nAnd, the scientists were quite surprised by\nthis move as this was one of the first cases\nwhere the seeker AI seems to have broken the\ngame.\nWhat happens here is that the physics system\nis coded in a way that they are able to move\naround by exerting force on themselves, but,\nthere is no additional check whether they\nare on the floor or not, because who in their\nright mind would think about that?\nAs a result, something that shouldn\u2019t ever\nhappen does happen here.\nAnd, we\u2019re still not done yet, this paper\njust keeps on giving.\nA few hundred million rounds later, the hiders\nlearned to separate all the ramps from the\nboxes.\nDear Fellow Scholars, this is proper box surfing\ndefense\u2026then, lock down the remaining tools\nand build a shelter.\nNote how well rehearsed and executed this\nstrategy is - there is not a second of time\nleft until the seekers take off.\nI also love this cheeky move where they set\nup the shelter right next to the seekers,\nand I almost feel like they are saying \u201cyeah\nsee this here?\nthere is not a single thing you can do about\nit\u201d.\nIn a few isolated cases, other interesting\nbehaviors also emerged, for instance, the\nhiders learned to exploit the physics system\nand just chuck the ramp away.\nAfter that, the seekers go \u201cwhat?\u201d\n\u201cwhat just happened?\u201d.\nBut don\u2019t despair, and at this point, I\nwould also recommend that you hold on to your\npapers because there was also a crazy case\nwhere a seeker also learned to abuse a similar\nphysics issue and launch itself exactly onto\nthe top of the hiders.\nMan, what a paper.\nThis system can be extended and modded for\nmany other tasks too, so expect to see more\nof these fun experiments in the future.\nWe get to do this for a living, and we are\neven being paid for this.\nI can\u2019t believe it.\nIn this series, my mission is to showcase\nbeautiful works that light a fire in people.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4223, "text_template": "[Excerpt from

Title: How to Study & Learn Using Active Recall | Dr. Cal Newport & Dr. Andrew Huberman\n\nTranscript:\nTell me what you think of this,\nwhat I always call, protocol,\nif I want to learn something\nfrom a manuscript I\nread or a book chapter,\nI used to highlight things.\nAnd I had a very elaborate,\nextracted from my university days,\nsystem of stars and\nexclamation marks and underline\nthat mean a lot to me,\nthat, yes, bring me\nback to a given segment\nwithin the chapter.\nBut a few years ago,\nI was teaching a course\nin the biology department at Stanford,\nand for some reason,\nwe had them read a study\nabout information retention.\nAnd I learned from that study\nthat one of the best things we can do\nis read information, in whatever form,\na magazine, research\narticle, et cetera, a book,\nand then to take some time\naway from that material,\nmaybe walk,\nmaybe close one's eyes,\nmaybe leave them open, doesn't matter,\nand just try and remember\nspecific elements.\nHow much does one remember?\nThen go back to the\nmaterial and look at it.\nAnd I've just been positively astonished\nat how much more information I can learn\nwhen I'm not simply going\nthrough motor commands\nof just underlining things\nand highlighting them,\nbut stepping away and thinking,\n\"Okay, yeah, oh, I don't remember\nhow many subjects there were.\nI'll go back and check that,\nmaybe make a note.\nAnd okay, they did this,\nthen they did that, and then,\"\nand then it's crystallized.\nAnd as I say this, I realize,\nof course this should work,\n[laughing] this is the\nway that the brain learns.\nBut somehow, that's not the way\nwe are taught to learn.\nYeah, well, I'm smiling\nbecause when I was 22,\nI wrote this book\ncalled \"How to Become a\nStraight-A Student,\" right?\nAnd the whole premise of the book was,\n\"I'm going to talk to\nactual college students\nwho have straight A's\nand who don't seem\ncompletely ground out, right?\nLike, not burnt out.\nAnd I'm just going to\ninterview 'em, right?\"\nAnd the protocol was,\n\"How did you study for the\nlast test that you studied for?\nHow did you take notes for the last?\"\nSo I was just asking them\nto walk through their methodology.\nThe core idea of that book\nwas active recall.\nThat was the core idea,\nthat replicating ideas,\nwhat I used to say is,\n\"Replicating the information from scratch\nas if teaching a class without\nlooking at your notes.\"\nThat is the only way to learn.\nAnd the thing about it was,\nit's a trade off.\nit's efficient, doesn't take much time,\nbut it's incredibly\nmentally taxing, right?\nThis is why students often avoid it.\nIt is difficult to sit there\nand try to replicate and pull forth,\n\"Okay, what did I read here?\nHow did that work?\"\nIt's mentally very taxing,\nbut it's very time efficient, right?\nIf you're willing to\nessentially put up with that,\nwith that pain,\nyou learn very quickly.\nAnd not only do you learn very quickly,\nyou don't forget.\nIt's almost like you have a\npseudo-photographic memory\nwhen you study this way.\nYou sit down to do a test\nand you're replicating\nwhole lines [laughing]\nfrom what you studied,\nthe ideas sort of come out fully formed\nbecause it's such a fantastic\nway to actually learn.\nIt was my key, the whole premise\nthat got me writing that book\nis I went through this period\nas a college student\nwhere I came in freshman year,\nwas a fine student,\nnot a great student, but a fine student.\nI was rowing crew and I was\nsort of excited to do that.\nAnd then I developed a heart condition,\nand had to stop.\nCongenital wiring in the heart,\natrial flutter thing.\nIt meant I couldn't row crew anymore.\nSo a prolapse of some sort?\nIt was a circuitry issue\nthat would lead to a\nextremely rapid heartbeat.\nIt's like really rapid,\nlike tachycardia, right?\nYou get 200-250 beats a minute just,\nand it could be exercise induced, right?\nWhich is not optimal,\nyou could take beta blockers,\nwhich would moderate\nthe electrical timing,\nbut beta blockers reduce\nyour max heart rate.\nAnd if you're a athlete\nwhere the entire thing that matters\nis your max heart rate,\nso you're doing something\nlike a 2,000-meter rows,\nyour performance on beta\nblockers just goes down.", "start_char_idx": 0,

rows,\nyour performance on beta\nblockers just goes down.\nIt makes no sense, it's like\nbeing a basketball player\nthat wears weighted shoes,\nit's too frustrating.\nRight, and it also makes you super mellow.\nI was a pretty mellow guy.\n[both laughing]\nBut I was a worst rower.\nSo I stopped that, and I was like,\n\"Okay, I want to get\nserious about my studies.\"\nI said, \"I can get\nserious about my studies\nand writing,\" right?\nThat's when I actually made the decisions\nthat I then stuck with for\nthe next 25 years after that.\nBut one of the things I did to\nget serious about my studies\nis I said, \"I'm going to\nsystematically experiment\nwith how to study for tests\nand how to write papers.\"\nAnd I would try this, \"How did it go?\"\ndeconstruct experiment.\nTry this, \"How'd it go?\"\ndeconstruct experiment.\nAnd active recall was the thing\nthat turned me all around.\nAnd so I went from a pretty good student\nto 4.0 every single quarter,\nSophomore year, junior year, senior year.\nI got one A minus\n[laughing] between my sophomore\nyear through my senior year.\nIt was like this\nmiraculous transformation.\nIt was active recall.\nI rebuilt all of my studying,\nso if it was for a humanities class,\nI had a whole way of taking notes\nthat was all built around\ndoing active recall.\nFor math classes,\nmy main study tool was\na stack of white paper.\n\"All right, do this proof,\"\nwhite piece of paper,\nand just, \"Can I do it from scratch?\"\nIf I could, I know that technique.\nIf I don't, \"All right,\nI'm going to come back\nand try it

me\nthat I would have to pretend\n[laughing] during finals period\nthat I was going to the library to study\nbecause I would be done studying.\nThis active recall, it's brutal,\nbut it's incredibly efficient.\nYou sit down there,\nI would have my cards\nand I would mark it,\n\"Okay, I struggled with this,\"\nI'd put it in this pile,\n\"I got it done,\" I'd put it in this pile.\nAnd so then you would just go back to the,\n\"I struggled with it,\" pile,\nand work on that.\nAnd then make a new, \"I\nstruggled with it,\" pile.\nAnd these would exponentially decay.\nAnd so in a few hours,\nyou could really master,\nwith a few other tricks that worked,\nyou could really master the\nmaterial pretty quickly.\nAnd then, what am I supposed to do?\nI didn't do all-nighters.\nIt wouldn't make any

and by\nthat of course they mean everyone with\nan iPhone 15 Pro or better it's able to\ndo amazing things like analyze all your\nphotos and email to prompt chat GPT help\nyou cheat on your homework and send\ncreepy generated photos to your friends\non their birthday and so much more\nbecause we're talking about Apple this\nnew feature is already receiving a\ndelusional level of Praise from the\nmainstream but it does have some haters\nlike Elon Musk who made an empty threat\nto ban intelligent Apple products from\nhis companies and in today's video I'll\nexplain the unpopular opinion of why\nApple intelligence is actually kind of\ndumb it is June 11th 2024 and you're\nwatching the code report yesterday Apple\ngave the keynote for its worldwide\ndeveloper conference but the reality is\nthat WWDC is not for developers it's for\nshareholders Apple Inc used to be the\nmost valuable company in the world world\nbut was surpassed by Microsoft and\nNvidia just a few days ago that's\nunbelievably humiliating and for the\nlast year everybody's been asking when\nis Apple going to do something with AI\nwell yesterday Apple made a genius move\nthey rebranded the acronym AI from\nartificial intelligence to Apple\nintelligence an idea at stole from\nAlibaba surely A3 trillion company has\nthe resources to train its own large\nlanguage model well apparently not\nbasically Apple intelligence is able to\nunderstand the context of everything\nthat's going on on your device like your\nemails photos and so on this experience\nis built into Apps throughout the system\nthen perform useful actions like set\nreminders in your calendar based on\nwhat's going on in your life now Apple\ndoes have its own AI models that run on\ndevice and it will attempt to use those\nas a first Resort but if those models\nare too dumb to get the job done it'll\nthen prompt GPT 4 remotely you'll be\nable to access chat GPT for free and\nthat sounds pretty similar to those\ncreepy co-pilot plus PCS that everyone\nwas freaking out about last week to be\nfair Apple does have a much better\nreputation when it comes to privacy but\nhow could they possibly share your data\nwith open AI remotely and still call\nthat private well they introduced a new\nthing called private Cloud compute that\nallows your phone to offload complex\njobs to the cloud Apple claims it will\nnever store your data your requests and\ninformation will not be logged and this\nprivate Cloud will be audited by Third\nparties to ensure your private data is\nnot leaking somewhere it shouldn't be\nhowever the reality is that your data is\nbeing processed by some Clos Source\nsoftware on a server connected to the\ninternet that's not yours Apple has\nalways stated that it will never let the\ngovernment use the back door but for\nanyone who really cares about privacy\nthis is likely not acceptable what's\neven more crazy though is Apple's\npartnership with open AI their Tech now\nhas its tentacles inside both Microsoft\nand Apple products and apple\nintelligence is a big win for Microsoft\nbecause they're entitled to 49% of open\nai's Future profits it's a really\ninteresting thruple situation that we've\ngot going here and apple might even let\nGoogle get in on the action too by\noffering Gemini is an alternative to GPT\n4 ultimately though normal people don't\ncare about privacy and they just want a\nuseful iPhone the new features in Siri\nwill allow you to get a lot more done by\njust talking to your phone and it makes\nthese new devices like the rabbit R1\neven more dead than it was on arrival\nbut Apple intelligence also killed a\nbunch of other startups like it'll also\nbe able to rewrite text and fix grammar\nthus making grammarly obsolete but the\ncoolest app was this handdrawn AI\ncalculator which will make virtually\nevery other calculator app obsolete in\naddition your iPhone will also be able\nto generate crappy AI pictures and you\ncan even create your own custom emojis\nbut really the biggest thing that died\nyesterday was anything that was a CH GPT\nwrapper because now your iPhone is\nbasically just a chat GPT wrapper that's\npretty awesome but if you're

\ud83e\udd16\n\nTranscript:\nWhile we look at the exact rules here, I will\nnote that the goal of the project was to pit\ntwo AI teams against each other, and hopefully\nsee some interesting emergent behaviors.\nAnd, boy, did they do some crazy stuff.\nThe coolest part is that the two teams compete\nagainst each other, and whenever one team\ndiscovers a new strategy, the other one has\nto adapt.\nKind of like an arms race situation, and it\nalso resembles generative adversarial network\na little.\nAnd the results are magnificent, amusing,\nweird - you\u2019ll see in a moment.\nThese agents learn from previous experiences,\nand to the surprise of no one, for the first\nfew million rounds, we start out with\u2026pandemonium.\nEveryone just running around aimlessly.\nWithout proper strategy and semi-random movements,\nthe seekers are favored and hence win the\nmajority of the games.\nNothing to see here.\nThen, over time, the hiders learned to lock\nout the seekers by blocking the doors off\nwith these boxes and started winning consistently.\nI think the coolest part about this is that\nthe map was deliberately designed by the OpenAI\nscientists in a way that the hiders can only\nsucceed through collaboration.\nThey cannot win alone and hence, they are\nforced to learn to work together.\nWhich they did, quite well.\nBut then, something happened.\nDid you notice this pointy, doorstop-shaped\nobject?\nAre you thinking what I am thinking?\nWell, probably, and not only that, but about\n10 million rounds later, the AI also discovered\nthat it can be pushed near a wall and be used\nas a ramp, and, tadaa!\nGot\u2019em!\nTe seekers started winning more again.\nSo, the ball is now back on the court of the\nhiders.\nCan you defend this?\nIf so, how?\nWell, these resourceful little critters learned\nthat since there is a little time at the start\nof the game when the seekers are frozen, apparently,\nduring this time, they cannot see them, so\nwhy not just sneak out and steal the ramp,\nand lock it away from them.\nAbsolutely incredible.\nLook at those happy eyes as they are carrying\nthat ramp.\nAnd, you think it all ends here?\nNo, no, no.\nNot even close.\nIt gets weirder.\nMuch weirder.\nWhen playing a different map, a seeker has\nnoticed that it can use a ramp to climb on\nthe top of a box, and, this happens.\nDo you think couchsurfing is cool?\nGive me a break!\nThis is box surfing!\nAnd, the scientists were quite surprised by\nthis move as this was one of the first cases\nwhere the seeker AI seems to have broken the\ngame.\nWhat happens here is that the physics system\nis coded in a way that they are able to move\naround by exerting force on themselves, but,\nthere is no additional check whether they\nare on the floor or not, because who in their\nright mind would think about that?\nAs a result, something that shouldn\u2019t ever\nhappen does happen here.\nAnd, we\u2019re still not done yet, this paper\njust keeps on giving.\nA few hundred million rounds later, the hiders\nlearned to separate all the ramps from the\nboxes.\nDear Fellow Scholars, this is proper box surfing\ndefense\u2026then, lock down the remaining tools\nand build a shelter.\nNote how well rehearsed and executed this\nstrategy is - there is not a second of time\nleft until the seekers take off.\nI also love this cheeky move where they set\nup the shelter right next to the seekers,\nand I almost feel like they are saying \u201cyeah\nsee this here?\nthere is not a single thing you can do about\nit\u201d.\nIn a few isolated cases, other interesting\nbehaviors also emerged, for instance, the\nhiders learned to exploit the physics system\nand just chuck the ramp away.\nAfter that, the seekers go \u201cwhat?\u201d\n\u201cwhat just happened?\u201d.\nBut don\u2019t despair, and at this point, I\nwould also recommend that you hold on to your\npapers because there was also a crazy case\nwhere a seeker also learned to abuse a similar\nphysics issue and launch itself exactly onto\nthe top of the hiders.\nMan, what a paper.\nThis system can be extended and modded for\nmany other tasks too, so expect to see more\nof these fun experiments in the future.\nWe get to do this for a living, and we are\neven being paid for this.\nI can\u2019t believe it.\nIn this series, my mission is to showcase\nbeautiful works that light a fire in people.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4223, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

doubt, one of those works.\nGreat idea, interesting, unexpected results,\ncrisp presentation.\nBravo OpenAI!\nLove it.\nSo, did you enjoy this?\nWhat do you think?\nMake sure to leave a comment below.\nAlso, if you look at the paper, it contains\ncomparisons to an earlier work we covered\nabout intrinsic motivation, shows how to implement\ncircular convolutions for the agents to
